1,"We couldn't be more thrilled with the work of Andy and his team to produce our Basketball team warm-up gear. He helped us find a high quality, affordably priced item that looks fantastic! On top of the great product, these hoodies were turned around in less that two weeks including design time. We will absolutely call on Canadian Custom Apparel for future orders!",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
2,I placed an order online of a design I created on their website. Easy to use. I wanted matching hoodies for me and my boyfriend for our anniversary. They turned out perfectly. Except I made a typo when I was designing the hoodies. I contacted them and they fixed it for me! Can't even tell anything was changed. Looks original. My boyfriend loved them. The hoodies are so soft and comfy too. Great gift and great service from the team!,Canadian Custom Apparel,A
3,I've never ordered custom T shirts before and I decided to go with.Canadian Custom Apparel based on Google reviews..I'm grateful that I did. Very happy with the quality of the shirt and the image printed on it.

4,"The folks at CCA have been a joy to work with..we are now so grateful to have found Canadian Custom Apparel, as we have had some bad experiences in the past with other similar companies.
Everyone has been super helpful and we are and incredibly happy with all the finished products! We will be bringing all our future business here.",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
5,Super Impressed! Just received our order! I've tried SO many online stores for apparel and I have been disappointed every single time. Canadian Custom Apparel is the first company to not let me down! We love our new shirts! The embroidery is top quality on a great golf shirt! We will be repeat customers forsure!,Canadian Custom Apparel,A
6,"Terrible company to deal with after repeated attempts via email and phone I finally got a response. All the DTG printing on every hoodie I ordered came off after a couple of washes. Now, in order to replace them, this company wants me to take pictures of all the hoodies side by side. Kind of hard considering they were given out to customers as promotional gifts. Garbage service! Terrible customer service! Do NOT deal with this place. They do NOT know what they are doing.",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
7,"Thank you Canadian custom apparel for an amazing job on some hats for my company. I highly recommend their online store as well, I ordered these online in less than 5 mins and they were at my door under a week later. I haven't seen anything like this quality and service after using so many different companies for my apparel over the years, You have a customer for life!",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
8,Test washed this HERO2020 Hoodie DTG printed by Canadian Custom Apparel. After the 5th wash I've noticed the print lifting and flaking off. The details were not holding up. I asked why this is happening and they blamed my design is causing it. They cannot reassure you with a good print. I asked for compensation and they did not consider it.Unfortunate experience with these guys. Was hoping better.,Canadian Custom Apparel,A
9,"Two separate sporting spirit-wear Club orders, and wow so impressive.Being able to re-produce photo quality prints on team-wear took our club's projects to the next level!.Decorating process allowed our creative side in creating the most impressive projects, and they.nailed it! Amazing service, and impressive quality in printing..40 kids and parents were delighted with the finished.clothing.
Andy is exceptional to deal with, always positive and ensures you get your order on time.",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
10,"Andy helped my organisation deliver a ridiculously last minute order, for over 400 participants. Without Canadian Custom - we could never have pulled off the promo shirts we wanted. Not only was he incredibly pleasant to work with, but his professionalism and willingness to assist with the order went above and beyond. They even took care of manipulating our image to make our vision of what we wanted work within printing constraints (something zero other suppliers were willing to do). I can't say enough about how excellent they are. You won't regret it.",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
11,"These guys at Canadian Custom Apparel are top notch! If you want quality products at the best prices available look no further..Excellent customer service and a true pleasure to deal with..Don't hesitate, call them!.You won't regret it.",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
12,Andy was a pleasure to work with! Our merch turned out better than expected! The Embroidering and screen printing were incredible and our customers loved the quality of the threads. Definitely our new spot for future apparel drops!,Canadian Custom Apparel,A
13,"A total Con Artist Organization. I Don't recommend CCA! Poor customer service. Didn't deliver on quality embroidery as their promo video suggests. Tried to over charge me an additional $20. Nothing they did was professional. Wouldn't even try to correct the issue, once I showed them how bad of an embroidery job was done. Any positive review is done by internal associates. Don't trust the positive reviews.",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
14,"Had an amazing experience working with this company in creating custom designs for my daughter's birthday. The team is extremely professional and highly experienced and produce exceptional quality work.

15,"Exceptional Customer Service, Great Quality Products! I have been a customer of Canadian Custom Apparel for over five years. Ordering items both for professional and personal use, Andy and his employees have gone above and beyond to assist me. They are quick to respond and give their feedback and suggestions when necessary; they made my vision come to life with ease. CCA perfected each of my orders with patience, professionalism and creativity. My products were detailed, of high quality and they were able to meet my short deadlines!
I highly recommend Canadian Custom Apparel! I can't wait to place my next order with them.",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
16,Quality products with quality service! Worked with Andy to come up with a complete design for my first ever shirts and it was a great experience.

17,"Great products and service (Just Like Hero Fleece Hoodie & Bella T's). This was our first order with CCA and we are very pleased by the service, delivery timelines and response to our inquiries.",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
18,"I ordered from CCA last week for a client which required a lot of changes in the initial quote. All the while, Andy was being extremely helpful and understanding with each quote request that came through.
When we ordered, they got the job done expediently and delivered to the client on time for a launch for which the embroidered materials were required.
Thank you to the whole CCA team for you hard work and a special thank you to Andy for providing top-tier, white-glove service throughout. The next client that needs embroidery will be getting their merch from CCA. :)",Canadian Custom Apparel,A

Our sales rep, Alex, communicates and collaborates with us very well. We look forward to doing much more business with them in the future.",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
20,Great website and easy order process but poor printing quality. I ordered a sweater for in-store pickup. The printing itself was uneven and the color of the fabric can be seen through parts of the printing such that it seems seriously worn. When I asked the person at the counter about the print quality I was told it was the type of printing that was offered for that item. Hopefully this is just a one off experience.,Canadian Custom Apparel,A
21,I had a big order for my company..Alex was supper great and supper helpful. So many times we had to change the order and adjust things. He personally took all my phone calls and responded to all my emails promptly. When I received my order everything was great and with good quality. I will definitely work with Canadian custom apparel for my next order and will recommend them to everyone.,Canadian Custom Apparel,A
22,"I have ordered apparel from Canadian Custom a couple of times now and I'm impressed with the quick service and great quality. There have been a few glitches with some t shirts in our orders but Andy has always made it right which says a lot about the integrity of this business. Sometimes accidents or things can happen but it's how you handle it that makes customer service stellar. Need custom apparel and want to support a local Canadian company? Order from these guys, you won't regret it! :)",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
23,"I am quite new to designing and ordering customized clothing, however, with Alex's help, I was able to create wonderful, personalized hoodies! He has been extremely helpful in guiding me through the steps, and has been patient and kind during several order adjustments. The hoodies came in excellent condition and the designs came out great! I will definitely consider reaching out to Canadian Custom Apparel again in the future.",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
24,"After researching screen printing companies for a month I came across Canadian Custom Apparel..I appreciated how clean their site was and the services that are provided. I made an order of 25 hoodies and the customer service I received was exceptional. They were very open about costing and had wonderful communication (they even provided suggestions for the best options based on the type of company I was starting). The products I received are great! Anyone who has seen them are surprised they are screen printed because of how clean and precise the design came out. Really great results, employees, and customer service.",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
25,"There are a dozen shops that will print off a shirt for you in no time& i'll admit the few day wait period at Canadian Custom Apparel threw me off initially, but when I received my order I knew the wait was worth it..The quality is next level, there was none of that uncomfortable, awkward texture to their prints that crack after the first wash. I can run my hand over the tee and the transition from fabric to print is seemless, all the intricate details of my artwork were captured beautifully, every one of my clients has been super happy with how vibrant the shirts are and the overall quality..On top of it all I love knowing that I'm supporting local Canadian business, which is more important then ever during these times, 5 stars all day boys",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
26,"They have a fantastic team at Canadian Custom Apparel. I ordered jerseys for my softball team and our rep Andy was very responsive, provided insight on what he thought might work best for the design, and completed our jerseys in a short amount of time. I would highly recommend using them if you ever need to make jerseys for your team. Thanks team!",Canadian Custom Apparel,A

Great customer service. Looking forward to doing business with Canadian Custom Apparel in the future.,Canadian Custom Apparel,A

Safe to say I'll be coming back to them for my other team shirts",Canadian Custom Apparel,A
35,"Fantastic service and even better product. The shirts turned out extremely well detailed and high quality, I had both small text and qr codes on the shirts and they were both legible and functional. Turn around time including shipping was extremely fast, while designing I called for a some brief questions and was instantly on the phone with a helpful staff member.",Canadian Custom Apparel,A

40,At first I was so excited to start an ecommerce platform with this company then found out that the only one who would be making money would be them. With their 22 dollar shirts and their 20 dollar shipping charge I would have to.charge 80 dollar's for a no name brand shirt..I had to pay 70 dollars for.sample shirt..I laid them 150 dollars for a service I cannot use and they don't offer any refunds. Was an expensive lesson to learn,Canadian Custom Apparel,A
41,"The customer service with this company was outstanding. They email quickly and back it up everything they do with a great product. If you need any custom apparel, then go Canadian Custom Apparel.

Would highly recommend ""Canadian Custom Apparel""!",Canadian Custom Apparel,A

54,"Not impressed. Brought a $200 jacket to get embroidered here. They made their own digital key and insisted that it would work. After numerous attempts to call and no call back to let me know if it was done I went in to see them.

I have had jackets stitched, shirts with transfer as well as screen printing - all perfect. Can't say enough!",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
72,"Placed an order for 65 items in June. Completion date was July 8 and I chose to pick it up. July 8 came and went with no contact from them, I called and emailed looking for updates. The event I needed the shirts for has now passed but my order is still not ready. July 28 I get an email saying my big box is now ready to be picked up. I asked since it's no longer a rush, can they ship out my items and I will pay shipping. I complete the credit card authorization form to proceed, was told by the finance department I wouldn't need to pay for shipping. (Thank you for that, since it's 3 weeks past when the order should have been ready!) A week later, I still don't have my order so I call again. Was told it would ship later that day and arrive the next day. I get my package excited to finally have them after 6 weeks.My package.Contains 2 shirts! Where are the other 63 items? I call again and was told those 2 shirts were the back ordered items and the rest of the order is ready for pick up! You can imagine my frustration when I tell them it was all supposed to ship. Their response. You will need to pay for shipping!.Here we are over 2 months later still going round and round. I have 2 out of 65 items, they have my $1800 and I've completed all the necessary paperwork to have my items shipped. Fingers crossed this happens soon! I would no longer recommend them especially if you are looking to have your items in a timely fashion. Quite disappointing.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
73,"As a designer, working with this supplier was easy and straightforward. Their online proofing setup worked well and it was easy to send them a corrected file after the first proof. Delivery was earlier than estimated, print quality is good, shirt specs are clear and easy to understand. Thanks, guys! I ordered a few dozen shirts in two cuts for a staff association.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
74,"Recently placed a second order in November, with plenty of time for the items to arrive before Christmas. Was hoping to sell these on my site, and make some Christmas sales as a small business owner. When the order arrived, over 50 items were defective, and were unfit to sell. After contacting their resolutions line, they were quick and hassle free to offer replacements. Although since this offer, the customer service has been terrible. I was told they would ship out last Friday, but they won't reply to me to confirm if that's happened, if they have started making the replacement items, or provided any tracking information. So I'm left waiting, wondering, if and when my items will arrive. Which clearly won't be in time to sell before Christmas. Quite frustrating.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
75,"After reviewing this shop I got a call from customer service who talked to me about my issues and fixed the problem! Thanks so much Kim, I really appreciate your patience and responding quickly to me! Received sweatshirt in a timely matter but was not correct. Will only communicate through email telling me I didn't search the proper logo when on my end there is no where to search it. Very disappointed with the customer service. all I was asking was for the club logo to be added",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
76,"The quality is not bad but the customer service is terrible. This is not the first time I have issues so will no longer use them. They would not let me modify my order as i needed to add more items,.under the pretext it's in ""production"" but.the last time I order it took months to receive my golf shirt because they are ""special order"". They also do not honor the discount they advertised on their website.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
77,"Best print on demand company I have used! Amazing service, amazing follow up reminders of orders forgotten in the approval process!
Mr. Brar the owner took the time to contact me and help me solve my problems!
Thank you!",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
78,Terrible customer service. Ordered blue polo shirts 6 months ago and then green ones 3 weeks ago. The logo on the green shirts is much smaller than the blue shirts even though it's a repeat order and I never made any changes to the logo. Contacted customer service and was told by Anna that this was my fault since I approved the order. Such arrogance ! Will take my business elsewhere in the future !,Entripy Custom Clothing,D
79,"I ordered hats for a conference, was guaranteed they would make it on time. Day after day the order was delayed by their production department. I reminded them daily for two weeks and was assured they would make it on time. The hats finally arrived the day the conference ended. The hats were shoddily embroidered. Meanwhile, seeing the writing on the wall, I ordered backups last-minute from a local company. Those were completed on time and look excellent. This was my fourth order. I've had one good order out of four. I will never order from Entripy again. Nothing but lip-service.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
80,"Daughtereen from customer service was very nice, helpful and able to solve my concern quickly. Will buy again.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
81,My experience with Entripy has been very.good. Custom orders delivered exactly when expected and the quality of the clothing and prints has been perfect. No complaints at all and will continue to use them for custom clothing orders.,Entripy Custom Clothing,D
82,"After about 7 years of dealing with these guys. I have to say, stay away. Do you like delayed orders? What about forgotten orders? Or orders that were sent to their print on demand department (heat transfer printing) even though I paid for screen printing. What about calling their support line and getting told no problem we are rushing this order and then You find out the order wasn't rushed in fact it was still sitting in ‚Äúqueue‚Äù after 2 months.

The worst customer service I have ever received when buying branded apparel.

Just find a company that wants to actually support their customers and help them get what they paid for. It's ok when the company makes an error it's not a big deal but when they lie and delay you you further?!? Why?!?

Not a good choice unless you don't mind waiting and getting the run around.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
83,"Outstanding service from the initial phone call, to placing the order to picking it up. Very friendly and extremely helpful and the final product exceeded my expectations. And the price was very reasonable - the best part

84,"Ordered 20 hoodies for a high-school club, and it came down to a really cheap price. Order was ready (pickup) on time, no mistakes. But the quality was disappointing, and there was a bit of white print found on the neck of every hoodie, which was irritating. Custom clothing operation was good, but the general quality of the hoodies themselves were not great",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
85,Just ordered 2 joke t-shirts for a family event and was shocked at how well they turned out for $10 each!.The shipping is kind of a killer but was pleasantly surprised that there was no additional charge for differently designed shirts packaged in one order! The quality of the print is really spectacular - super bright and sharp. The t-shirt does seem a little smaller in sizing but I ordered larger because of previous peoples complaints. Definitely won't hesitate coming back if I ever need something printed again!,Entripy Custom Clothing,D
86,"Sadly I cannot write all the details of my review as it exceed the word limit. I placed an order on May 20th with a ""Hot Rush"". Expected to receive my proofs on Tuesday after the long weekend by 12:30 at the latest as they indicate 3-4 hours. I did not receive them until 3:40PM (after the production cut off). I was given a cut off extension until 5PM, I contacted by e-mail and phone with my changes. I did not receive he changes until 11:16 the NEXY DAY! I contacted multiple times and was assured the front logo WOULD NOT LAND ON THE BOOB. I was assured their standard print area for left chest was 5 inches from the shoulder seam for women. Their website also has a list that states the same. I was ASSURED my order would be completed and shipped on time for my event on the 26th. E-mail quote: ""We will not make you drive 5 hours to pick up your order. Rather, we will complete your order by end of day tomorrow, and have it shipped to your listed address via UPS Express Saver. UPS indicates it will arrive at your address by Friday. This will save you a trip down to the GTA, and will ensure you have your order in your hands before your event.""
That did not happen! I HAD TO DRIVE 5 HOURS TO PICK MY ORDER TO GET IT ON TIME! Upon my arrival, the shirts were still not ready and were in packing. I opened the box to look at them before leaving to find the front logo positioned RIGHT ON THE BOOB! I measured and rather than the promised 5 inch from shoulder seam placement it was sitting at 8 inches! Upon further inspection OVER half the order men's and women's had ink stains, smears and damaged/snagged material.
Initially they took immediate action to remedy the situation. They said they would not charge for the order AND reprint everything all at no charge! I was assured this twice by Sally te Kamp and Alva Troubetzkoi. I was also PROMISED that since there were no longer all the sizes available that I needed, they would print and send those sizes at a later date. They put me in a hotel and advised my new order would be ready in a few hours, this was 3:30 and I still have a 5 hour drive home. My order was not ready until 9:10 PM. Upon my arrival for pick up I could tell right away the front logo was still not at 5 inches this time it was too high, but had no more energy left so took as it. Upon further inspection later I realized even on the new order MULTIPLE pieces were damaged. ink stains/smears and damaged material. I slept a few hours and drove home at 4am the day of my event. This was an event in memory of 2 family members who have lost their lives to suicide so this meant a lot to us.
I sent Alva and Sally a list of all the damaged shirts in the new order, as well advised that 1 shirt was missing entirely a 3XL. I also included the shirts I was promised would be reprinted at a later date due to stock unavailability. I also sent pictures of the damage and notified that that I was not requested reprint of all new shirts but wanted to point out that the front logo position was still not correct at 5 inches is was now only at 3 inches. First 8, now 3, but their standard states 5. I even marked on a shirt the start and stop dots. Starting at 5 inches from the shoulder seam, and the logo was 3 inches in length, so finishing at 8 inches. NOT STARTING AT 8 AS WAS ON THE ORIGINAL, OR STARTING AT 3 AS WAS ON THE NEWLY PRINTED SHIRTS. I received a very disappointing e-mail from Alva today advising that they are refusing to print and replace the damaged pieces as well as the ones missing from stock unavailability. They are frustrated and retracting on their commitment because my expectation is to receive the shirts in the proper sizes I needed without damage to them. It is not my fault or error that even their second round of printing my shirts included ink stains and damage..So their commitment to customer service ended in a big FU. I am trying to add more photos of damage ink stains in particular but for some reason only this one image will load.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
87,"With so many suppliers and vendors out there, you would be best to stay away from these guys. Don't be fooled by the pricing! Their service is absolutely horrible. I ordered FOUR shirts. Just four for our grand opening. I ordered almost 2 weeks in advanced and they delayed the order two times to a date in which I would have zero shirts for the grand opening. They tried to make it right by express shipping me the shirts in order to make the grand opening. They sent me ONE. To say the least, there was no point in having one staff in uniform and 3 others not in uniform. So we had zero uniforms for our grand opening. Not to mention the 1 shirt they sent me was absolute trash quality. There are many suppliers out there that are local and will provide much better service. Stay away from Entripy! Buyer beware!",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
88,"Edit - Entripy has worked hard to fix the issues. I appreciate their realizing their was an issue and trying their best to rectify it. We have ordered product from Entripy numerous times. The product quality is as described; you get what you pay for. Nothing lasts very long. Shipping was never as promised, although that may have been because they had the wrong postal code and the shipping company would always say that our address did not exist. We had to make Entripy aware of the situation a few times before it was finally fixed. Last week we ordered a bunch of sweatshirts based on previous sizing..We had found Mediums were small and Large were mediums. This time larges were extra large. They could do nothing to fix them other than say we will pick up the old ones and then deliver new ones . Well we needed them for a event and they were not trying to help in a manner that suggested urgency. We have been repeat clients for many years but that does not seem to matter. If your only concern is price then this is your company!",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
89,"I placed an order for a sample. About 11 days later, I follow up just to be told some story about how the shirt had a hole in it, then another story of the shirt needs to be reprinted because the quality was not up to their standard. They then suggested it will take another 10 days for a reprint. I instantly requested the order be cancelled and refunded. Mistake happens, I get that. But there is no excuse for poor customer service and this level of ""he say, she said"". I have no confidence in using them again. I will say they provide prompt communication which I appreciate.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
90,"Amazing service and quality. I have ordered from Entripy twice. Entripy has exceptional customer service, I always got a reply back almost immediately and if not, maybe in 15-20 minutes max. Entripy met all my demands and the quality of the clothes were beyond my expectations. The embroidery on the 30 something sweaters I ordered was beautiful. These sweaters were also the cheapest of all the options I had looked at. The package took 1 day to arrive after it was shipped which is amazing! All in all, I would definitely recommend Entripy to anyone who needs to do a bulk order, and I definitely will be ordering again from Entripy for any custom clothing orders!",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
91,"Employees are a pleasure to work with. From the staff to the Client Care team, everyone is really good at their job. I had an amazing experience and will definitely use Entripy again. The designer created proofs fast and exactly how I envisioned it. The turnaround for the t-shirts were surprisingly fast. And Client Care team was able to resolve the small hiccup we had without any hassle. They pay good attention to quality requirements as well.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
92,"Originally I had a not so pleasant experience with this company, however, they did make the effort to fix it for me. I ordered rush service for team shirts. They came in and a few were misprinted (no numbers at the back when I paid for them)/1 never showed up. They informed me of the 1 that never showed a few hours AFTER the package was delivered! Then this happened again with the new shirts twice. 3 weeks later and I finally had all my shirts I ordered. The customer service department is very quick at responding and in the end, I received all my shirts and a partial refund for all of this inconvenience. If you're in no rush for your products, I'd recommend this company. The prices are affordable, the site is easily accessible, and the quality is good. Since this incident as well, I've ordered again and the process is was fantastic! 5 stars for their products and customer service",Entripy Custom Clothing,D

94,"Had the worse experience with this company.We ordered 8 printed t-shirt, got the design for confirmation where they altered the size of the print. We had to go back and forth 5 times(!) with the notes because every time we asked to get back to the original size, they said ok, and then didn't do it. Even their customer service girl (who was super nice) thought it was getting ridiculous. We ended up cancelling the order and put a new one with the size we wanted, which was supposed to be ready June 1st. Few days before we got an email saying it didn't go through their quality check so they need to re-do everything, ready 1 week later. Then we got an email saying they ran out of 2 of the sizes we needed, but agreed to give us a slightly better shirt in the same price. THEN we got another email saying that, once again, quality check didn't go, it will be ready June 11. In the end, we got ok shirts, all the same (have no idea which 2 are the ""better"" ones) and we got it on time because -we- called and asked, since they didn't even bother sending us an email saying we need to come get it. They did end up giving us $50 credit, but honestly, I'd never ever order from them again.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
95,I have had to place many orders over the years..Outstanding service and prompt delivery..Their team was quick to get back to me with any inquiries that I had..Krysta Scott in specific has been amazing..I have dealt with her on many of my orders..She always takes care of things..Great job!,Entripy Custom Clothing,D
96,"I placed an order of 61 sweaters for my graduating class at the University of Waterloo.After submitting the completed order, I received an email on the following day at 10 am informing me that the asset I had submitted on the website is not supported and would need new assets. I sent them the updated assets an hour after receiving the email, and heard nothing until 24 hours later because I was told digital proofing would require 5 hours by a client specialist over the phone, even though it stated 3 hours on the website. After providing Entripy with the correct assets and approving the mockup, I heard nothing for a week. Then on the day my order was supposed to be finalized and shipped out, I received a call at 6pm informing me that there had been a stock issue. 9 of the 61 order will not be printed and produced in time. I was given the option to either wait indefinitely for the 9 missing sweaters to arrive, or receive the incomplete order of 52 sweaters 2 days later than the promised 5-day turnaround. My experience with Entripy had been very unsatisfactory. With problems and unpredicted delays every step along the production pipeline. They definitely do not live up to their promise of ""5-day turnaround"". I had originally chose to go with Entripy because of the fast turnaround period. I was willing to pay more due to how quickly they delivered the orders. Unfortunately my suggestion is to order from a competitor instead of Entripy. Traces provides much cheaper prices for the same service, but for a longer turnaround period.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
97,"Had t-shirts made for our.club and they turned out fantastic.. Very impressed with the service, quality and price point..And no set up charge!

98,"Quality of product looks fine. I used their sizing guide to a tee. Bought two products - a hoodie and sweats. Both were undersized. The leg length was about 4 inches too short. Arm length was about 2-3 inches too short and body was tight.
Their response when I mentioned this: Unfortunately, due to the custom nature of the clothing that is ordered, we do not allow for any returns, exchanges or refunds. This is why the box in the checkout is advising customers that all sales are final and by the customer checking the box, it ensures you've checked it for accuracy. Pretty hard to be accurate when you don't even have inseam or arm length as a measurement?.Sizes are based on waist, chest and weight . There goes $100+ and two gifts down the drain.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
99,"I have been ordering from Entripy for over 15 years - their service and quality is top notch. Orders always arrive on time and if there are every issues, the customer service team works with me to figure out a solution.

I have ordered some long sleeved shirt for my guys, when i picked em up i let few of members try it was a lot smaller than expected. I called the company and their rep have told me they cant do anything i stuck with what i got. so i decided to reorder bigger size, they said i cannot because its of production. This company tried nothing to satisfy or help me in this situation just a light sorry., wont use again and will make sure my contractors/friends will stop using them as well. They just leave you hanging with no customer satisfaction what so ever.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D

I really appreciated her help which will allow me not to hesitate to place another order.

104,"Entripy is the best custom apparel in the industry, I have been with them for the past few years now, and everything has been seamless when it came to the initial design, digital proof, pricing, and the product itself. Everything about this company is wonderful, in the past I have dealt with many other companies in which cant even come close to be compared with Entripy. Entripy has the most variety and customizability in terms of their products which made finding products very easy and interacting as the website allows you to add your own logo, text, etc. Everyone at the office is so friendly and kind which made the experience even better.  have ordered with Entripy countless amount of times and am happy as the first time I've ordered. Even though Entripy has many very large accounts, they have treated my orders with the same amount of superior service. Nothing but the best from this company!",Entripy Custom Clothing,D

Kind of disappointed that they won't just order these sweaters, while they wait for other sizes to be used up to make a large order.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
106,"My dad and I loved the shirt I surprised him with (it had his own artwork on it!). The customer support rep I talked to online was super helpful and very nice. My order only took 10 days from order to my door (Ontatio to Nova Soctia) I'll definitely.be buying some more cool stuff in the future. This shipping was a bit pricey but it is a long distance, at least for me and its pretty much balanced out by the cheap prices even on just 1 shirt. 9 bucks is a better deal than even Walmart offers for a shirt with a print on it. My suggestion would be to order a few different things at the same time for friends or family so the shipping becomes even more negligible. I hope this helps someone :)",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
107,"I did not receive my shirts on time, which I ordered in person in their warehouse and when I followed up with my order status, I was told that the order was ready for shipping on time and the UPS made an error and try to blame it on UPS. Doesn't not make sense, I have all email records and will take them small claim courts. I asked for my refund and they deny the refund..I had ordered online before from them and got my shirt shipped to me, but very low quality. Over all experience has been poor with this company. There are other companies out there that are more responsible and cost effective and better quality shirts. My experiences have been bad with this company, will let you be the judge.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D

We needed to make a revision in terms of the size of the logo and their team was super quick to do it! The shirts arrived a day later than expected but this did not affect us at all as we did not need them until later on in the week. From what colleagues have said - they sleeves on the shirt are a little tight. Overall, the logo printed on our shirts is of fantastic quality and the prices were great as well.

Recently, I needed a batch of t-shirts designed for a girls getaway but the company I had initially contacted was unable to meet my needs and my deadline. It was such a let down. I reached out to Entripy and the whole experience was absolutely exceptional. Even with short notice and a deadline to meet, Entripy exceeded my expectations by completing my order within 48 hours just in time for my trip!. The the packaging was very neat and the quality was on par. It is evident that the needs of their customers are their top priority Thank you Entripy for the great experience, I will definitely be ordering again!",Entripy Custom Clothing,D

Overall, I had an okay experience dealing with Entripy. their customer service is promptly, and T shirts turn out nicely. However, with only 30 T shirts, their staff is already running into quality control issue. I can't find enough trust in Entripy to order a large quantity of products. Everyone make mistake, but many mistakes like this can be detrimental to a big company over time. I will definitely order again, but will keep it to a smaller quantity in the near future.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
112,"Orders are delayed - delivery expectations were off by 4 days thus far (full order still not in yet). They explained its due to Covid. I accept that.

Not sure what to expect..I ordered the Euro Spun Tees hoping the Tee-Shirt fabric was a soft, but its not the soft fabric quality I was hoping for..I'm a feeling a little disappointed.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
113,"I will never be using Entripy again. I placed my order online thinking it would be easy and straightforward, but this was not the case. After submitting my order there was confusion regarding whether or not artwork was required. I spoke with someone online through their chat option who told me artwork was mandatory, but then received different information from one of the customer service reps over e-mail who said it was not. For a company who claims to be Canada's leader in custom shirts you would think their staff would be aligned and know what is required and what isn't. When my order arrived there were typos on 2 of the jerseys (it was very obvious these were typos ‚Äì a name on the back that should have had an ""√©"" at the end had ‚Äú√É ¬©‚Äù instead). Clearly no one checked the order before sending it out which is very disappointing. How is a final check not done before sending shipments out to customers? After reaching out to Entripy and informing them of the mistakes, they told me they would arrange with UPS to pick up the jerseys to bring them back and fix them, and then send them back to me. These jerseys are for a team that has already started the season but Entripy ensured me I would have the corrected jerseys back within 3 business days. Well I received the jerseys and THEY WERE NOT FIXED. They sent back the same incorrect jerseys. How unprofessional! Did they even look at the jerseys when they arrived back to be corrected? A simple order of jerseys has turned into a headache to deal with. No apology was offered when I informed them of the typos and I doubt anything will be offered when I inform them that they once again have messed up. I will not be using Entripy in the future and definitely won't be recommending them to anyone.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
114,"Had a terrible experience with Entripy when I wanted shirts printed. The first run of shirts had holes and was not screened on, so all the colors were faded and incorrect. I reached out to customer service, who offered another print room, which had incorrect colors and everything was extremely blotchy. I didn't even ask for a refund afterwards. I got stuck with 2 boxes of unusable product. I definitely would not recommend.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D

From working with their art department to verify and modify our prints, to meeting our admitally unreasonable delivery times, every interaction I had with Entripy and their employees exceeded my expectations. Not only did they have the best prices out of all the companies I've previously dealt with, their quality of product met the strict requirements we held our suppliers to. Entripy's customer service was proactive and made the entire experience painless and pleasant. When you're running a business you don't have time to sweat about the little things - let Entripy know what you need and be confident it will be done right and on time - the first time. I highly recommend using Entripy for all your custom apparel needs!",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
116,Wonderful service and great prices. Ordered a batch of sweaters for a team and had them made quickly and at a much lower price than I had expected. Amazing with proofs and helped me get the exact look I wanted before going to production. One sweater did not pass quality control but they worked with me to get a replacement issued immediately. No complaints whatsoever.,Entripy Custom Clothing,D

122,With COVID-19 I have found Entripy's level of customer support has dropped dramatically. I put in an order for Father's Day shirts more than two weeks ahead of the day. They got the first order wrong and I had to redo it. But it was still supposed to be ready the Thursday.before Father's Day. When I received no confirmation email I had to call them on the Friday to ask where the order was. It wasn't until Sat they confirmed the order would not be ready. If they had at least called to share this without me having to prompt them I would give them 3 stars. If you need an order done in a timely fashion you should avoid them for now.,Entripy Custom Clothing,D

124,"I had a decent experience with Entripy . So I first ordered about 20 sweatshirts with a simple embroidery and some customizations. They messed up on 2 of them, therefore they did not ship with the rest of them. So, I contact customer service and they send them over. easy. however they both arrived either in the wrong size or with the wrong customization. Then it takes nearly 1.5 months for one to arrive because they ""don't have it in stock"", meanwhile, it clearly is in stock on their website. I think i emailied them over 10 times back and fourth to coordinate the correct sweatshirt. But I was eventually refunded, so that was fine. But the only reason why I keep ordering from Entripy is the AMAZING prices. It is SOOOOOO much cheaper than competitors and the quality is so amazing. They have so much selection mainly for apparel and not the mention the live chat is FANTASTIC. They will literally reply to your question within 5 minutes and the fact that its a real person is so much better, whereas a robot can't help you with a specific question. I've asked so many questions and they're literally so helpful. They also have so many sales all the time, which is so amazing, so make sure to subscribe to their email list.

Since then they have sent me market emails that have no where to unsubscribe in the email, so after being annoyed by 5 or 6 of them I emailed client care which has their email listed on the bottom of these emails..I have emailed them 4 times, not got a reply, and still get the marketing emails that I have asked to stop. Maybe this will get their attention.

Entripy offered small credit on next order which was not satisfactory to me - why would I want to place another order after this fiasco? Asked for owner to call me - twice. Heard nothing.

138,"Entripy is a great company with great products. I would insist on them not using UPS to deliver their products. They shipped my product 7 days ago and my package is still ""being delivered"" by UPS. I live 15km from Entripy's facility. UPS is literally the worst company ever. Entripy, please switch delivery companies!",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
139,"If I could give this place negative stars I would. I requested some changes, and they uploaded the proof, to which I accepted. Got a confirmation email saying it was in production. My credit card was charged. Having accepted the proof of the order last Friday (6 days ago), they contact me 2 days before the due date and basically gave me an ultimatum. Accept the charges for the additional changes or have your jerseys delayed. Ridiculous. Basically strong-armed me, as I needed the jerseys to be on time. Can't comment on the jerseys as I have not received them, but this company clearly lacks customer service and communication. Will be my last order.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
140,"Upon first ordering our softball team jerseys they seemed very helpful, it wasn't until our order wasn't 100% and when I had asked for more that their customer service was an utter disappointment. Apparently ‚Äúit's not their problem‚Äù. We received a duplicate # on one of our jerseys and when asked if it could be replaced I was told I had to place an additional order with a minimum 6 jerseys ordered. The company wouldn't even provide the jersey that their production line didn't produce. As if it's my fault? Wouldn't recommend any company who doesn't stand behind their products. 2 big thumbs down ëéèªëéèª",Entripy Custom Clothing,D

143,"What a horrible customer experience.ordered 300 custom tee shirts for a promotion at our office. Spent money on advertising and giveaways and when our tee shirts arrived the logos were all way off centre. When they looked into it they said it was a problem with their printer alignment (great quality control). They offered me 10% off which I found as a joke as I was out all my planning, advertising and the entire promotion was a write off. I asked them to at least reimburse me 30% and re send them as that was equivalent to my loss. They refused and have definitely lost a longterm customer. Horrible experience, save your money and find someone else.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
144,"Shirt quality was alright, nothing spectacular, I've seen better and I've seen worse with other custom shirts I've bought. Seems like the only thing they care about is their public perception of their brand though. Paid $23 for a shirt I had to leave early for work to pick up because their shipping prices/times were insane and the size was abysmally different from what their sizing chart indicates. My girlfriend is regularly a small shirt size. Got her measurements according to the ""length and width"" image they provide. Measurements of my girlfriend are 15"" width and 20"" length. Sizing chart says small fits someone 16"" width and 25.25"" length, so good right? I get the shirt and she can't even fit it over her shoulders, not even close to fitting.I contact customer service asking what the deal is and they email me saying they can't do anything about it. So I ask if maybe they can give me a discount or something on another shirt? Finally a week later someone bothers to respond to me and say they can do 10% off another shirt. Almost a slap in the face. Thanks for the offer of $2 off. I need to find another custom t shirt for my girlfriend's birthday now but I'll definitely be going somewhere else.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
145,"To put things simply, terrible quality control. I ordered a bunch of shirts and hats from them and when I opened the box I was impressed. But then a few days later I started to notice problems. The embroidery had loose spots on every single hat and I had to send them back to get fixed, and the screen printing on the shirts was not smooth at all. It's very rough and bumpy. It looks like it was done by a little kid. I would not recommend this company to anyone as there are much better places to go to.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
146,Would never use this company again. We used them once for shirts with limited success. Tried them a second time and found them to be the most disorganized company ever. We wanted a redesign for our new shirts which they said they could help with which wasn't true. They kept sending us old proofs which we didn't like and they kept coming back saying they look good and we should go with them. Honestly would go with any other company. AVOID,Entripy Custom Clothing,D
147,This year the Queen's Commerce Service Initiative worked with Entripy to have custom sweaters made for our committee.

148,"I'm sure they're a lovely company but their communication sucks..No notice that there is a proof to look at, no reply to first message - had to contact again to enquire, waiting for an email to say item is done.nada..I know it's only one item, but the one item is what you use to test if you will use the company for larger orders in future..You'd figure an automated email to say item is ready would be standard..sigh.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D

150,"I had a really bad experience with them. I ordered around 70 hats and went through the process of getting the logo transferred and etc. The images of the final product didn't resemble what I received. The customer service process was very poor in terms of communicating the exact type of hat, the quality of the hat, and the size of the hat. so i basically got 70 hats that totally sucked and that no one would really want to wear. I followed up about it, and had a pretty bad time with that customer service as well.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D

155,10/10 customer service. Really impressed with Selby and the fast replies to my inquiries. Finally a Canadian t shirt printing company that makes things simple and fun. Can't wait to order more shirts.,Entripy Custom Clothing,D
156,"STAY AWAY. Entripy is riddled with issues, from managment through to production. Although the salesperson was nice. Issues through out the entire process, my products had crooked logos/company names as well as embroidered the wrong size, 3 TIMES the wrong size. 6 hats were good. 6 t-shirts only 2 were delivered and had crooked logos/ company names. 6 high end shirts out of stock.1 hoodie was excellent. 1 week later when shirts were in stock 5 hoodies were added and I was told I now have to order 24 hoodies at $60 a piece in order to get hoodies.what am I gonna do with 24 hoodies? Unbelievable business practices. After many emails and frustration Entripy agreed to make me 5 more hoodies exactly like the first one. What I received wasn't even close! All shirts and the first hoodie have a 4"" company name on the left chest and 12"" across the back.they sent me new hoodies with a 12"" company name right ACROSS the chest. Doesn't look professional when I have employees with all different logo designs. STAY AWAY from Entripy, THERE IS NO QUALITY CONTROL OR CARE that goes into the printing and embroidery into the products they sell.and their business practices are suspect. If you don't care what you get then this is the place for you. If you want it done right.BUY SOMEWHERE ELSE.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D

160,"The worst customer experience I've ever had! I am starting a new graphic tee store and submitted Entripy's wholesale request form on their website two weeks ago. After submitting the form, I followed up with their customer experience team to find out when I should expect to hear back about my application ‚Äì they told me the approval process takes a couple days (it actually took 2 weeks!). In addition to asking when my application would be approved, I also asked if they needed my Business License to validate that I was actually a business they said it wasn't required which was very surprising to me because all other suppliers that I have a wholesale account with (in both Canada & the United States) have required my business license and/or HST # to approve my application. While I was waiting for my wholesale application to be approved, I ordered one sample tee (at regular price) to see Entripy's quality for myself. I included a poly bag in my order so I could decide if I wanted to use poly bags when I ship to my customers. Sure enough my sample order arrived WITHOUT the poly bag. After 2 weeks of following up with Entripy's customer experience team several times, I was told that my wholesale application was not approved. I asked why my application wasn't approved and they wouldn't give me any more information other than ‚Äòmy application didn't meet the criteria'. If I don't know what the wholesale criteria is, how can I possibly consider Entripy as a future supplier when my business grows? It's very disappointing that Entripy doesn't support (all) aspiring entrepreneurs in the GTA!",Entripy Custom Clothing,D

I look forward to working with you again.",Entripy Custom Clothing,D
167,"I ordered some promotional t shirts and chose the digital printing option. When they arrived, I was disappointed to see that the printing was more like a heavy plastic transfer than a print directly on the shirt (I have had shirts digitally printed in the past by CafePress and VistaPrint, and they both came out nicely, with the ink directly on the fabric, so that you cannot feel the design and the shirts drape nicely.) With the heavy plastic design, the shirts did not drape naturally, and the design area wrinkled in an ugly ""folded"" kind of way. Also, my design had been given a white outline around all parts, which made it look different than I had intended. I requested a reprint on a heavier t shirt, hoping that the difference in thickness between the fabric and transfer would be less noticeable, or if that wasn't possible, a refund. Entripy replied that they did not give refunds on customized clothing, and that a digital print on a heavier shirt would be the same as the ones I had received. Their suggested solution? That I order a new set of shirts, silk-screened, at ""a one-time 15% discount off of that order"". Apparently their way of making amends to an unsatisfied customer is to try to sell them more product.
I let them know that this was unacceptable, and have yet to hear back from them 9 days later. Seems their new tactic is to ignore me. I cannot in any way recommend this company to anyone. Next time I will go with VistaPrint. (I've also used VistaPrint for printing business cards, postcards, etc, and when I ran into problems a few times, they simply reprinted my order correctly in a timely fashion at no charge, with no hoops to jump through.)",Entripy Custom Clothing,D

One I placed the order and paid, Greg came back with a suggestion for a different colored red which I said ok too and I am glad I did because the shirts look great, better than what initially expected. They delivered everything within less than 10 days which is what they promised. Thanks alot to all the guys at E-Tshirts, I am really happy with my company shirts, you did great job and really came through for me on the short timeline!",Etshirt,E

304,"whatever honest review me or you leaves here is gonna be covered by a nice comment from the owner defending his janky services. my friend ordered hats & it took over a month for him to get news on the order and around another month for him to receive an incomplete order. he told him it would take around 12 days.he basically took his order and told him they would start it next but then proceeded to do an order of 300 hats for someone else. he didn't hold his word. it might of only been a verbal agreement but, playing with your customers like this cannot go unnoticed. the lack of professionalism was never acknowledged & a discount wouldve been considered good customer service but, the owner clearly doesn't care all that much about his customers.i was a client myself multiple times over the years to print t shirts with DTG and, i had issues with them everytime.",Etshirt,E

Etshirt is such a great company which everyone should know about. If you know anyone who needs t-shirts of any design,just tell them of Etshirt, I promise you that he or she will not regret the decision of shopping here. ",Etshirt,E

Then I decided to order hats for my bachelor party and their quality is the best compared to all others I have seen.

310,"Etshirt rocks ! I really mean it ! I couldn't recommend them more highly. And this is why: a previous company we had worked with a few times had let us down on delivering a product and we were panicked to make our deadline. A business partner recommended me Etshirt so I gave them a shot. From the very first phone call I experienced nothing but friendly, enthusiastic and very professional service. Nothing is too much trouble. Extremely friendly and easy to deal with and great attention to detail was paid to the matching of colours, placement of artwork and general quality of the finished tees. I really won't be going elsewhere any time soon. This company is just fantastic! They are an example in top class customer service . Top that off with super efficient turn around and a quality product and you won't want to deal with any other company. Well done guys! An absolute pleasure!",Etshirt,E

I have a collection of T-shirts with my favorite memes thanks to this store! Every time I find some new meme I send them an e-mail and after 4-8 business days I get a new T-shirt. The Digital Printing is amazing, it's astonishing how great it looks! I also use Etshirt store to order hats that match my T-shirt. Whenever I meet with friends they always notice my apparel, it can't be missed! I like to express myself through printed T-shirts and hats, it's a lot of fun! I think everyone should try it, it's a nice conversation starter. It shows who you are as a person, what you like, and what is your sense of humor ‚Äì it allows to meet people that fit into your world. I am very happy that I discovered Etshirt store, maybe I will become the customer of the year :D",Etshirt,E

Their delivery and payment method was so less stressful and wonderful. I got exactly what I wanted at a fair price. The quality was something I had never seen before. With the price being cheap and affordable, I expected hats of probably a lesser quality. But honestly what I got really exceeded my imagination and I was really happy. When I delivered that of my friends to them, they were all speechless and decided that we need to order more as soon as possible. These hats are the best anyone could ever have. Etshirt thanks for making me add this beautiful hat to my collection. It was an amazing experience and I look forward to contacting you guys again.",Etshirt,E
314,"My journey with Etshirt store began with a phone order, which was very convenient for me. I always liked to make orders with a phone, someone asks you questions and writes down all the necessary information. Then, I just e-mailed the pictures I wanted on my T-shirts, and the order was complete. I paid for expediting the process, and I got my T-shirts in 3 days. I needed the T-shirts fast because of an upcoming event, so I was grateful for the rush option. What also made me happy, was that I was able to choose my favorite T-shirt brand ‚Äì Etshirt store has a variety of brands to choose from. Before making the purchase, I checked that the firm exists since 2004, which made me think that the order will be handled without any problems, as the firm exists for a long time. That's what exactly happened, and what made me write this review. I will be definitely coming back to Etshirt store.",Etshirt,E

Such an excellent performance with well designed outfits. I had to think on how to have similar t-shirts as soon as I saw it! I quickly searched for the store to place an order and I found it beautiful. I described what I wanted. At first I thought the logo won't come out as expected. The delivery was made quick And Yay the colors were brilliant and clear to attract attention and good wishes. The logo was large enough, and clear, placed exactly in the front middle. I got more in high spirits to have the t-shirt to remember the trip. Thank God to the only moment I got honored to watch the band perform.

Very happy from this brand",Etshirt,E

324,"In our high school in Montreal, we have different types of people. As a group of 7 close friends, we wanted to distinguish ourselves from the rest of the school. We had many different ideas, but one stuck with us and we executed it. The idea was to buy custom-made T-shirts ‚Äì that's why we found Etshirt store. At first, we tried out one pattern with Digital Printing. After seeing that the product was nice and we got exactly what we paid for, we started making orders every other week. We always order a similar message on our T-shirts, but in a different setting, different style or form. That way we look different, but we are connected. I am thankful to the Etshirt store for enabling us to do that. And it's awesome that a customer can speed up the process (paying a little extra), and get his original T-shirt in up to four business days. When an unexpected party appears on the horizon, you definitely want to use that option!:)",Etshirt,E

And their customer service, I can't begin to explain how nice they were and really friendly. Figuring out the right shirt wasn't even an issue because they had various nice shirts and I knew which ever one I picked would look pretty nice on me and I wasn't wrong.

339,"Let me tell you how my path crossed with Etshirt store. I coach a hockey team in Calgary. My school ordered T-shirts in Etshirt store for our hockey team and the kids loved them. They asked the school to order more T-shirts so they could wear them not only while playing hockey matches or in training. They wanted to be able to proudly wear the team's T-shirts also while they were beyond school walls.
This experience with Etshirt store gave me an idea for presents for my two boys. Every now and then they find some movie star or a cartoon character to be their hero. The Printed T-shirt gives me a gift opportunity that allows my boys to express themselves, and they really enjoy those gifts. Those T-shirts light them up and give them something interesting to show to their peers. I like to see sparks in their eyes when they come home from school and tell a story involving the T-shirt I bought for them.
With my wife we sometimes get ourselves a gift of a printed T-shirt with some slogan, to show our support for each other, or with an inside joke that only we understand. I wanted to thank Etshirt for enabling us to do that:)",Etshirt,E
340,"Etshirts thanks for always making me stand out. This would be my second purchase and you guys have never failed to deliver. You all are so amazing; your t-shirts are of the best quality and are always unique. I recently had a birthday party to attend with my best friend and we really wanted to wear matching t-shirts. I told her about etshirts and after going through the website she agreed to us ordering and insisted she did the shopping herself. It was really amazing how cool the customer service was, they responded to her every queries with so much patience and politeness. Honestly you all just won an extra shopper for life. Our t-shirts arrived 1day before the due date and I must say I got exactly what I ordered. The colors were matching, the sizes perfect. Etshirts gives you exactly what you see. Thanks a lot. It was a wonderful experience.",Etshirt,E
341,"I decided to post my experience here with etshirt because it was indeed a great one and I look forward to purchasing more items from them. I have always known about the website but never used them until last week and I must confess it was the best online deal I have ever done, and I regret not trying them sooner. I needed a creative and flashy outfit for my music band, and I wanted something affordable and of great quality. After much thinking, I decided to search through etshirt website, and I saw spectacular designs that appealed a lot to me. I ordered for exactly 50 pieces and in different sizes. And everything was processed smoothly and on time as well. Three days after my package arrived, and it was exactly as I ordered, all the sizes perfect for each band member.

343,"You must be searching for what to wear underneath your work shirt at an economical cost. ET-Shirts will overpower your anticipations. The tees are perfect day and night outfits since I'm Tshirts enthusiast. This round was my second time ordering the solid Tshirts. I purchased the 2x for my husband, too.

The prices offer excellent value and are well-made; this is all I'll buy now. The fabric is superb with a unique style, and don't shrink much.

A soccer team gave me the task of getting 12 jerseys for them and I was quite hesitant to accept because I didn't want to deliver a poor quality of jerseys, but I later took the task. I searched the internet extensively day and night, until I stumbled on etshirts and thoroughly went through their website. I was amazed at what I saw, and all the positive reviews about how awesome their service is and how they deliver the best. And right there I decided to order from them, it wasn't even a hectic process. I made my selections and color and the customer support was extremely helpful.

The T-shirt was a hit, everyone loved it, my co-workers still reminisce about the printed image:) Etshirt offers a plethora of t-shirt brands to choose from, which allowed me to pick my favorite one ‚Äì Nike. On the Etshirt website, you can order a t-shirt by phone, by e-mail, or you can use a Creator Tool to specify what you have in mind the tool is very helpful. At work, we ordered a funny poster from Etshirt. It came in vivid colors, and looks exactly as we wanted. It makes us smile every time we look at it. It became a business card for our team at our firm. We will probably order another one soon. For our co-worker's birthday, we ordered a T-shirt with his favorite scene from Star Wars.

Etshirt store was the answer to our monotony at the office. I began to order T-shirts for the whole company every month. Every employee can decide what will be on their T-shirt, and we have casual Fridays so that wearing this T-shirt would be possible at work. Those T-shirts are supposed to loosen up our workers and boost morale. It allows our workers to express themselves and show something intimate about their lives to their peers. I am very happy that I discovered Etshirt store, the T-shirts made us smile many times. We have a tradition now, that every time someone has a birthday, the firm buys this person a T-shirt, and their team chooses what on that T-shirt will be printed.

I spent a lot of time looking through different websites trying to get good merchandise for me and my family but many were of poor quality and did not look comforting at all. I showed my children a couple of items from ETShirt and they loved it. My daughter is very much into the rock genre so we customized her one with a logo of her favorite band and now she won't stop using it every day. My son is more casual and is satisfied with simpler clothes and without much design, he likes more unicolor.

Since it became a part of my usual attire, I wanted to have a plethora of possibilities to match the rest of my outfit. That's when I found Etshirt store. They made it possible for me to create plenty of emblems that I was dreaming about. After I was satisfied with many different hats in many colors fitting divergent kinds of wardrobe, I started to buy T-shirts. It was great that I could synchronize the T-shirt message with my hat emblem. When the weather got colder I ordered some hoodies making even more parts of my attire printed. I became so accustomed to my outfit sending some kind of message that I feel almost weird when I don't have anything printed on my clothes. I like that I can share an idea with the outer world by just showing up dressed in a particular set of clothes, I recommend that to anyone:)",Etshirt,E

I was skeptical because my boyfriend usually doesn't buy online because he doesn't trust most of the websites, but I guess christmas put a little bit of faith in him. We got the sweaters and everything is just fine!
Funny thing is, we went to a party just a few days ago and the sweaters got our friends attention and my boyfriend and I received a lot of praise! We're thinking maybe do a themed party and, if we do, we will contact etshirt again to buy more!",Etshirt,E

So I felt we need a change and moved about several shops hoping for something superior. Awkwardly we spent time eyeing for alike designs to Etshirts. In some way the search clearly-fell through the cracks. Went to some store and we couldn't place an order. :blush:

Cheers to ETshirts. We drove back for help and customarily my requests got responded to. I left with a buying order that got accepted by my hubby instantly. So my worry began, as I assumed the delivery would take longer. In less than a week we received the hoodies and tees.

Well as a customer of over 5 years, I have tested this brand and can boldly beat my chest to say it is trusted. In all my years of patronizing the ETshirt brand not once have I been let down. Which features excites me more? The question should be which feature on the platform is not exciting, talk about the quality of printing, it's just impeccable, talk about their creativity levels and designing skills? Don't even get me worked up on how they attempt to save the local folks some cash with their low prices and discounts.
I've looked around and no other printing brand could match not to talk of passing the mark that the ETshirt brand has set for years, they are just marvelous, I'll give them that.",Etshirt,E

One thing I must say is that this company deals with almost everything there is and they are the best. After series of disappointed by so many online companies who couldn't deliver the exact specifications I needed, etshirts came to the rescue in the twinkle of an eye. Etshirts is actually the best bet anyone could have. I came across their website by chance; I needed an alternative solution as soon as possible. After thorough search I landed on their site and it was really like a divine breakthrough. At a point I was confused on what to pick, lol, after I made a choice then the customer support put me through the whole payment process and I got my package two days later, and exactly what I ordered.",Etshirt,E
402,"I play in a band, we are based in Toronto. We used Etshirt store for the first time a couple of years ago ‚Äì we bought T-shirts for one of our concerts. We liked it some much that it became a standard for us to print different T-shirts for every concert. Those T-shirts enabled us to send a message, while we were playing, about what we thought of current events that were happening in our industry and our genre of music. We became recognizable because of our opinionated T-shirts. Our band would like to thank Etshirt for enabling us to express ourselves, and for being so quick with the delivery (sometimes we had a new idea for a T-shirt shortly before a concert, and Etshirt store always came through ‚Äì we used the rush option for speedy delivery). Placing orders at Etshirt store became part of our routine. There was no concert where we wouldn't have new T-shirts. We love the possibility to express what is on our mind with a short line - a brief T-shirt communiqu√© that everyone will understand.",Etshirt,E

So, I wanted to surprise them and get them their own team jerseys. It took me a while to surf the web to find the right printing company but when I found the Etshirt page and their Sport Team T-shirt & Apparel Printing Promotion, the decision was made. The reason why I am actually writing this review is that there are tons of other companies on the web and many of them simply don't deliver the quality you expect. Not these guys! The jerseys, the print, the details, everything was EXCELLENT! The kids from the neighborhood were ecstatic :))) Thank you guys for making me the coolest neighbor ;)",Etshirt,E

Etshirt really saved the day and up to now my friends and I do our t-shirts shopping in this company",Etshirt,E
412,"When I first made contact with ETSHIRT I was hesitant to go through with the purchases because I was trying to slow down my expenses, especially during the holidays with money quite literally flying around preparing for the holidays: buying food, getting gifts to the kids, house decoration, etc. That being said, as I scrolled further and further through the many categories displayed in their website, I soon found that the prices are reasonable and affordable, and that I could spare some money to get me a couple of pants and shirts, which is a lot to say because I don't often do shopping. My wife takes care of it and I'm more than happy to let her decide what she considers looks best on me - I don't usually mind what I wear, if she's happy then I'm happy as well. Luckily my taste in clothes were good and both her and my daughter admitted the couple of pants and shirts I got from etshirt definitely look good!",Etshirt,E

The t-shirt was incredibly beautiful. It is now the most outstanding clothing in my wardrobe since it is of high quality.I was really happy and when I enquired my grandma where she had gotten the t-shirt,she told me that she had ordered it from Etshirt.

She had spent weeks complaining about the lack of clothing she has and I figured the best thing I could do was buy her a few clothing pieces. Christmas eve was almost upon us, so I decided the best way to get her something was through online purchases. In my search I stumbled across many online websites that claimed to be the best at what they do, yet they lacked basic services such as proper custome service and specific information about the products they were offering. Sometimes you don't even know if the clothing is going to be the right size!

With ETSHIRT was not the case. The variety of their products covers a lot of range for every person and they have the item's information displayed for everyone to see. Because of personal reasons I couldn't buy the sweater I wanted for my nice during christmas, but I was able to get in contact with ETSHIRT and finally I was able to do the purchases pretty quickly and efficiently, and the goal was reached! My niece loved the sweater!",Etshirt,E

To my shock, nothing went wrong, I got super customer service, on time delivery, cheap service and best of all a perfectly done work and it was awesome.

The easiest way we could do it was by printed hoodies/T-shirts, and custom embroidery on our hats. That's when we found Etshirt store. Getting dressed in customized outfit before skating became our ritual. After we bought a few of different colored T-shirts and hats with our logo, we started synchronizing our clothing so that everyone in our team would wear the same color. We look like a gang now, the nice kind of a gang.
We like to show that we are united in our efforts to get better, learn from each other, achieve more today than we were able to achieve yesterday. Every time we are skate, our attire reminds us that we are a team and we try to help each other whenever it is necessary. We hope people enjoy seeing our performance:)",Etshirt,E

It is very rear now to see cheap printing that lasts long but that is not the case with ETshirt, their prints could stay for a lifetime and still not lose a touch of quality.

Their methods of printing that uses DTG printing, sublimation and embroidery stands out and stands the test of time which makes me wonder why the prices are so low and affordable for work that good, I mean $3.19 for printing on a plain white shirt is the cheapest I've ever seen and probably the cheapest we may ever get to see.

Presently, I have sent 3 messages in the last week and have received NOT MORE ANSWERS.

If you believe in your luck.

571,"For doing business with Etshirt a few times. The 10-day period always turns into at least 5 weeks. Never returns calls and rarely responds to emails The quality of the screen printing is sloppy! Logo sometimes crooked lack of paint on the logo and stain of paint on the garment. For an unacceptable product, he does not even reimburse. I strongly advise against.",Etshirt,E
572,"Poor and confused customer service. I made an order only to end up not getting the sweaters in time. I was told: ""You did not pay the invoice that was sent to you.""
Nothing was sent to me. In addition, some information given on the site is false (Ready the same week! Yes, but by paying an extra 30% of the price).
Could be good for someone who only needs their shirts in 2-3 months and is willing to spend a lot of time communicating to that employee X who doesn't know their products or services.",Etshirt,E
573,I ordered a small batch of t-shirts without prints to see if the delivery time was reasonable. I haven't received anything after 4 months of waiting and Greg does not respond to emails. It's a shame that a company from Montreal decides to make a fuss in this way. P-e that the owner has problems which prevent him from managing his company like the world. I was ready to invest in several large batches of t-shirts without prints if the delivery time would have been reasonable but it will not be. Basically I had my money stolen and I never received my order in addition to having no explanation.,Etshirt,E
574,"Really very disappointed, I sincerely never experienced such poor service.
My order was placed and PAID more than 2 months ago and I still haven't received anything. I always have great excuses!
I have done business with you before and the service WAS excellent in the past.

I participate in public markets where I usually advertise nicely because the logo on the t-shirt attracts customers.
However, I will have much less praise for you when asked who I do business with.",Etshirt,E
575,"Our community organization Center Multi-ressources de Lachine had a bad experience. We had ordered promotional T-shirts and jackets for an event. Lots of unreturned emails, unanswered voicemails and calls. The validated order was finally canceled by the company at the last moment. We had left a first comment, under the account of one of our employees.
A representative of the company went to our offices, indicating that he wanted to meet the employee without informing us in advance of his arrival. We wonder how this representative found the employee's work address. Our management received the representative. He asked that the employee withdraw the comment but was in favor of leaving a comment on behalf of the organization. The representative asked that they be given a chance for future collaboration. As requested, we removed the first comment (in the name of the employee) and we reiterate our disappointment, given that we asked her to identify herself the representative did not have a business card and when we asked for explanations about the order, he told us that the manager of ETshirt, on the move in Italy, could not receive either the internet or the telephone. In short, it seemed complicated. It is for this reason, dear Mathieu from ETshirt, that our relationship is not a guarantee of quality. Thus we leave the comment on behalf of the organization.",Etshirt,E

579,"Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience with this company.
The customer service was very bad and I was totally disrespected.
Very slow response to emails and when I called, on 2 occasions, the person was talking to other people at the same time. I ended up being insulted and being told that anyway, they have plenty of other customers!

590,"I purchased my first custom t-shirt from FBT last week and I'm very happy with the result: the design and overall look is precisely what I expected. As a result, I'll definitely be back.

My only suggestion is for FBT to consider using shirts that are, say, 80 percent cotton / 20 percent polyester. That mix is less prone to shrinkage than 100 percent cotton and may also result in somewhat less colour fading for dark coloured shirts, especially black shirts.",Freshly Baked Tees Custom Printed Tshirts,F

I know I didn't mess up when using the design page on their website, because the thumbnail image they sent in the confirmation e-mail shows the design scaled correctly.

Still good enough to wear but also somewhat disappointed.

EDIT: Updating my review since I contacted them. I was basically told they couldn't print the design larger. So they took my money and sold me something they knew they couldn't deliver.

838,"TLDR version: stop reading this review and go to the store to get your tshirt made by this team. No negatives

Full review: had an order come in from a supplier on Amazon for a one off custom t-shirt. It was a grey shirt with black block letters; pretty easy ask. When it arrived, a couple letters were randomly missing in the string of text and one letter was also damaged, and not fully printed.

Went into the store and: 1) amazing customer service, including great conversation 2) they saw the issue and under 5 minutes had the solution and already printed onto the t-shirt (they have customer facing monitors so you can see them doodling up your request; was a great feature) 3) smiling customer

I have had bulk orders made or other custom jobs in the past. This was the cleanest, easiest, and best experience hands down.

conclusion: I may need to figure out how to need more custom t-shirts made just to go back and watch a fully vetted shop work from beginning to end.",Freshly Baked Tees Custom Printed Tshirts,F

844,"I was beyond impressed with the job that was done at this store! One of the employees, Naill, was extremely nice and helpful and did such a perfect job. I was thrilled with the final product! I'd also like to note that I went to ""Bang-On"" a few metres away before heading here, where I was told my design was ""too intricate,"" that it could only be put on a white shirt, that only one type of press could be used, and that the press was broken and unavailable until two days later. Fast forward to me at Freshly Baked Tees and Niall does the job right on the spot, uses my preferred grey shirt, and suggests a more faded ink to go wth the vintage look of the shirt. It looked even better than I could have expected due to the high quality! AND it was cheaper than Bang-On. No contest!",Freshly Baked Tees Custom Printed Tshirts,F

After meeting with Joe, I realised that asking him to print the shirts was the right decision..That was last season..And, this season we asked Joe to print our shirts again..In fact, there is no reason for us to use another printer as long as Joe is in business.

No matter if I am asking Joe and his staff to do a personal order or one for the league, they are always courteous and friendly..And, Joe was helpful when choosing the right shirts for our members..They are unbelievably quick especially with large orders and their prices are more than reasonable..And, our members love the shirts..They are soft and lightweight, which is perfect for playing softball on a hot summer afternoon.

When I need to get a shirt printed, it's easy for me because there is no decision to make..I just go to Joe.",Freshly Baked Tees Custom Printed Tshirts,F

1003,"Original rating 3 stars - Easy to work with them and quick service..Note that online prices are lower than in store..If I were to order again I would do the following - request that all t-shirts are the same exact style and that they are all printed on the same printer..In my order of 18 shirts I received three different versions of the women's shirts, one not particularly high quality and slightly different sizing..Half of the shirts were bright, glossy colours and the other half were like faded concert tees..Since I was ordering for specific people that wouldn't be comparing shirts this was acceptable for me but it was wasn't ideal..These two issues were not annoying enough to ask for reprints..Given that Freshly Baked Tees were the cheapest custom tees I could find and they met the deadline I would consider ordering from them again but I would be more specific in any future orders..Also note that the sizes fit VERY small - make sure you review the measurements provided.
Updated to 2 stars - worked with them again Dec 2022..Very frustrating experience..They lost my order and wouldn't help me when I dropped off my shirts to be printed (learned my lesson from last time and bought my own shirts)..They are very polite people and nice but organization is not their strong suit..I did another order at T-Shirt Guys and they were amazing.",Freshly Baked Tees Custom Printed Tshirts,F

He kept checking with us at every step of the process that we understood and that we were satisfied with the final product. He did a terrific job!

1071,"100% Fantastic experience with GetBold printing! This was the first time we'd ordered band t-shirts and after leafing through several websites and visiting local shops, GetBold definitely had the best rates we could find for what we wanted. The process of designing and ordering the t-shirts was a breeze, and after a quick and amicable chat on the phone our t-shirt order was placed and the printing began. What a surprise it was to receive the t-shirts only two days after shipping, and the quality was top notch!

1073,"Exceptional service.

Twice I've done rush orders with them and both times they followed through and even exceeded expectations..The second time I had a rush order they even delivered early..Communication is also prompt and clear.

If you're not familiar with the process of printing on shirts they're more than happy to offer their knowledge and expertise..Which for me, where I am largely uninformed about shirt printing I found undoubtedly valuable and appreciated.

Not only are they quick at turnarounds and offer great advice the product itself they deliver is great as well..The shirts they offer for their shirts are durable but comfortable and the graphics hold up after a lot of sweat and multiple washes.

Pricing is fair and reasonable..In fact our second run with only two colours was cheaper than anticipated which was a pleasant surprise.

There also is a really cute corgi in the office which is like come on dawg you gotta work with them now.

Highly recommended.",GetBold - T-shirt Printing & Embroidery,G

The time it took to print and mail out the shirts was surprisingly fast. Also as you can seen on the website, the company offers an impressively large variety of shirt types/fit/quality. My one minor criticism is that the minimum order quantity (15 units) is a bit high - i would have welcomed the option of paying a bit more per shirt at a smaller quantity.

I had the same knots in my stomach when going to pick up my order from GetBold for the first time. When I opened the boxes, I was delighted to discover that everything was TOP KNOTCH..The quality, printing, placement, sizing, garments - not one single error. How could this be?!

There min order is 12 for anything. We wanted to order at least 35-50 items and purchase the garments from them and have them print our company logos. We had two higher quality sweaters that they do not carry our request was to have them embroider the two sweaters that they did not provide or sell. They told us to come in and when we arrived they said they actually wouldn't want to embroider two sweaters if we did not purchase them there. They wasted our time and we took our business else where. From a business standpoint it made no sense at all for them to miss out on making a few thousand dollars and inquiring a new customer that would do more business in the future. I thought management is poor and simple minded as well as the owner. Very unaccommodating!",GetBold - T-shirt Printing & Embroidery,G

Amazing service, and equally awesome quality!",InstaCustoms,H
1684,"I was referred here by a friend.
I was told to talk to Nick and that I wouldn't regret it. He's useful, helpful, usually can figure out what the customer wants and executes perfectly.
With a recommendation like that I figured that I'd have nothing to lose, so I gave it shot!
Funny thing is the referral didn't do instacustoms justice.
They went above and beyond. More helpful than expected

I reached out to them in order to get an idea of pricing for t-shirts for our hockey team
The team's been having a rough year, but, they're a great bunch of kids so the coaches figured we'd get them something nice.

We decided to make a fun thing out of it and put the kids nicknames and numbers on the back and a team name on the front

Even though we were a little particular with the fonts and the sizes ranged from xs to 4x, Nick and his team obliged. Alison was fantastic, so helpful and cheery, a joy to work with. She had the fonts figured out in no time.

Not only that, the order was completed early, 2 days before the promised delivery date.

Finally the price, we had set a budget and instacustoms came through with flying colors

I cannot say enough good things about this place, to the point where I am going to start bringing my business business here

I don't refer many places but this is one place that gets my seal of approval

See below for a sample of their work",InstaCustoms,H

1729,"I was very impressed by this store's high rating for the amount of reviews it has, and I can confirm that it is very well deserved. I went in with a PNG file on a USB stick around 11am on a Saturday, hoping to get a custom mug made for a friends' birthday the same evening. They told me it would be ready in 20-30m, so I had a coffee and came back. When I returned, the mug had printed with a couple of issues. One of the colours wasn't showing up at all, and the image itself came out looking very compressed. The staff were super friendly and helpful, however, and we spent a little bit of time troubleshooting together on Photoshop (I had designed the image to be printed myself). After that, they spent about half an hour tinkering with their printer to figure out why the colour wasn't coming through for me. In the end, they were able to solve the issue, and they even went through 3 mugs for me until it was just right. I would have felt bad, but they were so kind and assured me that it wasn't a problem at all. I left with a nice product printed in great quality with all the right colours, and even with the issues that we encountered, the entire process only took about an hour.Quality product, reasonable prices, wonderful service :)",InstaCustoms,H
1730,"Great experience dealing with this company. Very fast response time, had a small issue and they resolved in a very timely manner,

1737,Insta Customs is awesome. Hannah in particular was so welcoming of all of my questions. I love the quality of my print. Thank you guys!,InstaCustoms,H
1738,"The service and price do not match the quality of goods. Let me elaborate.I walked in to get a logo printed on a polo for our company. The logo print and shirt cost 45$ + tax (you can find online for 10$ if you are willing to wait 3-4 days shipping with better quality shirts). The logo was too much on the left pectoral section of the shirt that it would fall into the crease of the armpit. The manager/owner agreed to redo the shirt at zero cost and on a medium shirt instead of small. At the same time, I brought in two shirts of my own to have the same logo printed. Mid way through printing the logo on the two shirts I provide, the manger tells one of his clerks that they need to make me sign a form consenting that if the material is not 50% cotton/50% polyester they can not guaranty the quality of the print, and that the merchant can no be held responsible..I do not sign the form, the clerk messes up one of the logo (confesses it's their wrong doing but informs me I've consented even though I did not sign the form). I get home to find out the logo printed on the medium shirt they have redone has the same issue, the logo is too much on the left instead of being 1 inch from the button line (as requested). I am confused on the lack of standardization and know how for a company who's clerks do the same work everyday. Will gladly change review if they agree to remaking logo.",InstaCustoms,H

1872,"I arrived at the store yesterday afternoon to have a Christmas present made for someone close to me. It was a zipper hoodie with a small print on the front and a large one on the back. I placed my order then went to eat something. I came back and was told that there was an mistake made and it was being corrected. That was fine.mistakes are human. Then I was asked if I wanted a white border around the back print. I gladly accepted. But then when I was shown the finished product, the white border was an irregularly broken white line around the back logo. It doesn't look good. One employee offered me a T-shirt as compensation. No replacement hoodie was offered. I refused the T-shirt since I had to make it home and travel many hours to see some family before Christmas. I could have mailed the hoodie to my loved one after Christmas once the replacement was ready. That's my issue. I paid 75$ for something I was completely dissatisfied with and I was offered something that was worth half of what I paid. The staff was polite and courteous, but I'm very frustrated and won't return there.",InstaCustoms,H
1873,"The entire process from start-to-finish
was a 10/10 experience. I would like to thank Ming for doing exactly what I want. This place is absolutely one of the best!",InstaCustoms,H

1884,"I ordered online and wantet it delivered to my house because I have a pretty busy schedule. My order was missing letters. When I emailed them, they were really quick in replying, however, I had to go to the store to have it sort it out. At first, they decided to keep my orders to re-sell it for 5$, but they ended up giving it to me which I am grateful because it was supposed to be an inclusive personal design..They had to redo all my 2 orders, so I ended up having to come back again. The employee.didn't wear mask. He made another mistake and this time, told me he has to re-sell it. When, he had asked me if everything.was okay, I looked at the print and found that it was crooked and so I told him. But he said that because I was right next to him, I should have told him before pressing (I mean I know that they just ""waste"" 3 hoodies because of print error, but it is not my job to tell them if it is well align or not). Anyhow, I am a bit disappointed on how this all went maybe I was really unlucky.",InstaCustoms,H

1896,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS BUSINESS. I've never ever write down negative reviews but I had this on my mind for too long. First of all the idea of shirt printing is very nice and simple but Instacustoms is not a destination for that, they will take away all the pleasure and happiness behind this concept and give you a hectic experience. I've witnessed numerous gimmick and unsatisfied clients in this store but always kept silence about it. I've done hundreds of shirt and spent thousand of dollars with this company and I still had a disgusting customer service from time to another. I've been working in the printing industry my entire life. The quality of instacustoms is great but the staff often remains unqualified due to poor and inadequate training. I wouldn't blame the staff at all because they are very sweet, polite and simply do their job. The lack of training is probably due to the high rotation of employees occurring because of the heinous administration. I would blame the sickening owner of this business. He's characterized as a poorly raised, rude and disrespectful person. He does not care about you nor your product and will make you go away to save a buck!.*** ps: look at my pictures attached***",InstaCustoms,H
1897,"I had a great experience with the staff here - when the design I submitted couldn't be printed exactly how I wanted it, Alison and Nick were able to come up with a great alternative solution. They took extra care to make sure I was happy with the final product before printing multiples. The order was ready that day and my whole team was so happy to receive their shirts! Thank you!",InstaCustoms,H
1898,Ming is The Man! He made me a couple work and I've only had good reviews from my people,InstaCustoms,H
1899,"Had a great experience at InstaCustoms. I designed my own drawing and wanted to have it printed onto some hoodies, one of the workers there (Ruth) was very helpful! She scanned, edited and made sure all the small details come out perfectly. Really appreciate the service here, will definitely come back!",InstaCustoms,H
1900,They took the time to address any concerns I had and they even delivered my package directly to me since I wasn't too far so I wouldn't have to worry about delivery breaking or delays. These guys are very awesome and make sure the product you want is exactly what you want. I'll buy again.,InstaCustoms,H

I definitely suggest checking out the place.",InstaCustoms,H

1933,"Normally I don't write reviews. Instacustoms are the best in the market. Dealing with them was very easy and service was 911 ( even better) They did mugs for my 3 kids in 30 minutes and delivered to my office. It was just as simple as sending them email with pictures and is done. No back & forth about pictures formats, file size etc etc. Hassle free experience. Today I am doing more mugs for my daughter's friend, Guess what on Sunday morning I have sent them the email and got a message at 11 am that's is Ready. They are not only fast but Quality of their work is amazing.I wish them prosperity and Growth.",InstaCustoms,H

1937,"Really bad experience with these guys. They quoted me a price for a big quantity of mugs for my business. When time to place the order, the ""owner"" started to ignore my calls and text messages. He had the audacity to block me instead of being professional and answer my calls. I knew he blocked me because when I tried calling with a different phone he answered and told me not to call him anymore and to call the store. When I called the store, the other owner told me they can't honour.the original quote they provided, even though I have it in writing. This screws up all my plans and promises I made my clients. Stay away from these guys.VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!",InstaCustoms,H
1938,Awesome service! Ming help me to customize a very nice mug with pictures for my girlfriend. Very recommended!,InstaCustoms,H

1942,"There's no comparison for same day printing services in Montreal. I've used this company on multiple occasions and been satisfied every time. Staff is very knowledgeable and accommodating and there's a variety of items that can printed upon. Sure, it's not as cheap as some other places but for the quality or the speed of service (literally 15 minutes), it's worth it!",InstaCustoms,H
1943,Nhu is very accommodating and she made sure I'm satisfied with my order. 10/10! I would definitely recommend this store and will come back! Thank you again!,InstaCustoms,H

1955,I had a great experience with Emma,InstaCustoms,H
1956,"The store is very nice, you have the possibility to choose a variety of items compared to other custom stores. The quality of the print is nicer. It's much fancier than just the transfer paper other custom stores offer. Honestly the service is great and the online service is fast and easy to do. You can choose designs on your own and bring them to life. I loved ittt.",InstaCustoms,H
1957,"The experience was amazing, I came looking for a price and I left with a few items thanks to the great service and the help I got from Ruth. She was amazing and makes me want to comeback and use InstaCustoms for all the orders for my business.",InstaCustoms,H
1958,"Don't be fooled by the ratings and reviews. You can go check the place out yourself but don't go just because the ratings are high. This place has a really good rating so I called to get some information. I spoke with Nick, asked him several questions and was told to ""go check the website"" for all my questions. To be honest, this is a very disappointing service. If a customer walks into the store and asks some questions, would you tell him to go check on the website? Being busy with a lot of customer does not justify your inability to answer simple questions over the phone. You could very well explain your situation such as ""I would love to answer your questions but I am currently really busy with other customers, so it would be best to look for these information on our website."" instead of ""Hey sir, go check our website."" All I am trying to convey is that the ""service"" I received was far from what the reviews say. Maybe I would've gotten a better response if someone else answered the phone instead and you would've had an extra customer.",InstaCustoms,H

1971,Service was good. They made a mistake with the order but rectified it. It took two days longer to receive due to the error but I don't mind as it was a small order altogether. They forgot to give me back my USB after I had emailed them regarding it so four stars.,InstaCustoms,H

1975,Had a great experience at InstaCustoms. The price was right and the quality of service made it quick and simple to get everything we needed. Big thanks to Nick!,InstaCustoms,H
1976,"The manager of this place is one rude and extremely uncooperative individual. You would think a customized printing place would be willing to help you get you your order done just right but the owner/manager wasn't even willing to change the colour of a text before printing! The staff is willing to help and is polite but the manager is a frustrated old man ready to snap at anyone who walks in! Very disappointed in their service. For the price they charge, their service is hopelessly bad! If you are looking to have an unpleasant experience with your custom printing project then by all means go to Instacustoms.",InstaCustoms,H
1977,They do anything you want on a shirt that you can bring yourself. Just amazing! Great job,InstaCustoms,H
1978,First time coming in to InstaCustoms - Great experience. I walked in and was immediately greeted and assisted by No√©mie. She explained the process and showed me where to find what I was looking for. We went through the font choosing process together and that was it! Definitely recommend InstaCustoms for any custom clothing/accessories you need.,InstaCustoms,H
1979,"Yes, their service is fast, but the result might also show that the job was done fast. The employee scratched some colour off the decal for my t-shirt and just asked me whether it mattered if she cut the part where the scratch was off. since they had to print a new one, she didn't ask if I wanted it bigger as I thought the first one could have been slightly bigger.then, they cut the design very fast, some white is showing on the side of the decal, and it was not printed completely straight.for that price, I may well buy my own transfers and DIY them instead next time.also, make sure your design is the right size and colour because they don't recalibrate before printing. Also, the staff could be friendlier.and their music is so annoyingly loud, we almost can't hear each other.",InstaCustoms,H
1980,"great customer service. really professional . quick service. great quality . so happy Thank you Nhu , she was so helpful and professional",InstaCustoms,H
1981,Very good customer service. Noemie is super friendly and understood right away what I was looking for. I was in and out within 5 minutes and a great shirt. Thank you very much!,InstaCustoms,H

2018,I really love the work done by mr.Ming thank you so much i'm in love with these prints ëåèªëåèª.,InstaCustoms,H
2019,"Wouldn't recommend. My experience with the company was in general a huge waste of time. The quality of the product is okay, however I believe that we have evolved into a society where the quality of the product is not everything and the experience of the client is also very crucial..On the website the company claims to be ‚Äú the only apparel print shop that is specialized and ready for all [our] last minute emergency orders.'' However, the company were not able to provide me with my order as we were in holiday season and the due date of the order was too tight for them even if they claim to specialize in same day orders. When trying to give them more time for the order the problem shifted to not enough profit. This explains my rating and my poor experience with them.",InstaCustoms,H
2020,Great service! Highly recommend this place. Thanks to Ming for doing a great job.,InstaCustoms,H

2028,Amazing work! Made a mistake when ordering but they corrected it without fuss. Thanks Sarah for your work!,InstaCustoms,H
2029,"Fun store, great location..Room for improvement would be to zimmer down on the snobbish ladies blasting music. Too focused on looking hip and not on costumer service. Had to wait like 10 mins before being assisted. This lady made it seem like it was grueling work to print a design. Moreover, earn your 5 star ratings. Offering $5 discounts in exchange for a 5 star review is unethical. Improve the quality of your service.",InstaCustoms,H

2120,"I visited Instacustom a few months ago in order to create samples for a company I am trying to start. My first experience with the company was good in general and the product they provided us was interesting. As we were satisfied with the sample we adapted our designs and returned to make new samples of the final product, which was also nice, but quite expensive to be honest as I am a student. When ordering the official product in larger quantity my experience got a lot less pleasant. After putting over 500$ in their product for tests, the designs were now considered complex, the prints were now considered oversized and too time consuming for them. In other words, I wasted a lot of time and capital. Also, I was kind of surprised as they claim to be able to ‚Äúput whatever you want onto whatever your heart desires. We accept all types of orders so don't be shy. There is no order that is too big or too small.‚Äù Therefore, I was disappointed with my experience with them.",InstaCustoms,H

2245,"Please avoid this place at all costs! The manager just tried to hit me!. I actually can't believe this happened! I brought a couple shirts I needed to print that I bought at Costco and they screwed one (the printing was noticeable disaligned and after trying to fix it, the shirt burned in some parts). They offered to give me a t-shirt but I needed a shirt which they don't sell. When I told them I needed the shirt replaced somehow, the manager came in and started yelling that the burning was some chemicals on the shirt and that the whole problem would be solved when I wash the shirt. He then lost his mind. He threw the shirts at me,.punched the table and started calling me offensive names and actually came from behind the counter to hit me! I then got scared and went to the exit. Some people passing by where intrigued about what was happening and I just started telling them what just happened. Then I look back and see the guy just coming back at me again, actually chasing me! It was until I got into the metro that the guy went back to the store, always yelling at me and insulting at me.

I am more impressed than angry at this point. How come a customer-facing store is able to survive with such an aggressive manager?

Awful experience, don't wish it to anyone",InstaCustoms,H

2788,"Expensive and incompetent staff. I do not recommend this place for embroidery.

Placed an order for embroidery of 3 Christmas stockings and it was a negative and frustrating experience. Got my stockings back without embroidery and a brown spot on the cuff.

After taking 10 minutes to place a straightforward order (which somehow required 3 different staff members to chime in and me repeating myself multiple times), I paid the whopping $80..I was quoted $24 in the email it the gal didn't clarify that the fee was PER stocking. Then I was asked to sign a waiver that absolves MAKE if they somehow screw up the project. not exactly a vote of confidence.

I'm told my order will take 14 days, not the 5-7 days that I was told.via email 12 hours earlier..I shake off it off, sign the form because I don't have time to look at other places.

The next day I receive an email (without an apology I might add) that they can't embroider the stockings and that I can come pick them up!

**What should have happened: The staff should have inspected the stockings on my first visit to determine if the project was feasible.

Three people gathered around the counter and not one person could do the intake professionally.. A waste of my time, no embroidered stockings and a lot of unnecessary frustration.

Upon pick up, I had a similar experience.. No less than FOUR people . One to initially talk to me, one to find the Xmas stockings, one to refund what I paid, and a 4th person to come talk to me to ask ‚Äúdoes this require any further resolution?‚Äù..I could not believe she said that.. No one was contrite or felt bad about the inconvenience or hassle. The ambivalence was a turn off. I get to the car , notice a brown spot that was not previously on any of the stockings..Do not embroider here.

MY COMMENT TO OWNER'S REPLY POSTED DEC. 2/2022:

I'm not entirely clear on what MAKE Vancouver means by ""setting the record straight"". My account is accurate and honest and already corroborated by MAKE staff in writing, which I've pasted below. Contrary to your reply, your team already acknowledged via email that they dropped the ball and were 100% at fault.

Following are the emails from your team, admitting MAKE's error pasted below.

MAKE Vancouver Email Responses - Nov. 29/2022:

#1:
Hi Maria,

Yes 100% we should have spotted this issue and we recognise the inconvenience of having to come back to the shop to collect the incomplete order.

#2:
After reviewing your stockings with our production team & management we have identified some issues that were overlooked by the team yesterday when you were in. As you know our main talking point was getting the sizing correct for you so I think this is why this happened. The issue is because of the way the stocking is sewn we can not embroider it to the standards we usually would. As a work around we did look at embroidering it differently but the metallic detailing on the stocking would affect the embroidery quality which we are not comfortable with.

So unfortunately we will not be able to continue on with this order for you. We would be concerned that the end product would not be up to our standards and embroidering the stockings could lead to damaging them.

We will obviously refund you the full amount ($80.64).when you come to collect them.
Megan.
Embroidery Coordinator

***MAKE: Pls don't change the story to say I was confused, didn't understand, or that you were helping me, when it was the other way around. I offered several solutions including abbreviated names, printing the names on paper to confirm fit, staying until your team was sure, and asking your team what they needed to fulfill the order. Your team, all 3, said they were too busy to confirm the size and fit, yet they were all just standing there. It's very unfortunate that you are deflecting and can't simply apologize.

Moreover, you did not do me a favour to accommodate an early pickup. Rather, I upheld you to your original promise of a 5-7 day turn-around stated via email 2x: ""It takes about 5-7 days to complete stocking orders.""",MAKE Vancouver at Granville Island,I

2790,"I just want to say how amazing my first experience with you has been. The website was very easy for me to use to create a custom product. I made these shirts for my best friends bachelor party and they turned out perfectly. As well I was extremely impressed with the speed of production and delivery. I ordered them and received them 3 days later. Fantastic service, great quality and very reasonable pricing. I will absolutely be shopping with you again and will recommend your company to my friends.",MAKE Vancouver at Granville Island,I
2791,"We went to this store on our last day in Vancouver. Their products were reasonably priced and tons of souvenirs to choose from. My daughters bought their Adrian Klis bags at the Capilano Suspension Bridge gift shop and I found mine in this shop. I was so happy to have found that they have the crossbody bag that suited my style. The owner (or so we assumed) was very friendly and was chatting with customers, he complimented my choice of Adrian Klis bag and showed us his own wallet and how the leather will turn out after a few years. I have read that bison leather develops a nice patina over time which makes each purse or wallet unique, and it's so interesting how smooth and nice his wallet turned out.
I have been using the bag eversince, I love it and I love the smell of leather! Honestly, I never thought leather could smell so good!.We probably would have bought more items if we were not travelling with carryon only. I highly recommend to visit their store if you go to Granville Island, you would not leave the place with an empty hand.",MAKE Vancouver at Granville Island,I
2792,"We are SO happy with how our company branded bottles turned out! The team at MAKE is excellent and they really came through for us on this order. We highly recommend choosing this friendly and helpful local shop for your next company branded merch order! Thank you very much, MAKE!",MAKE Vancouver at Granville Island,I
2793,"*Edit* I was reached out to by the MAKE staff and had a nice phone call with someone who I assume is the owner. She told me that the issue I had with the custom work was unavoidable as the material used in the process could only be as dark as it was and could not be made lighter. She also offered to help me replace the wallet with a different one for a discount if my sister did not like it. Therefore I would like to ammend my review and score with this new information. I would like to once again extoll the virtues of MAKE's wonderful staff. *Edit*

If I wrote this review after my first visit there I would give them 5/5 stars for their fantastic help and patience regarding my order. I went there just a week before Christmas and even though it was clearly very busy and late in the day I was able to find a perfect wallet for my sister, as well as work with their embroidery department in finding a custom image for it to be special.

Unfortunately, after picking up the wallet and giving it a look I realized that the thread that they used to write her name down was the same colour as the wallet itself, making it almost impossible to see unless you look closely. I am not criticizing their work, the shape and size are exactly what I was looking for, but I wish I could actually read the text.

I realized that it was messed up as soon as I took a close look at it. There is not enough time I think between now and Christmas to have them fix the issue so I suppose I will be wrapping it as is for her present. My only wish is that they had perhaps called/left a message letting me know about the issue with the black wallet/black thread. I gave them my number when I dropped the wallet off at the embroidery department so it would not have been hard for them to give me a quick call/text asking me if I wanted to switch from black to white thread, or something like that.

Like I said this review has nothing to do with the service and actual product. I still think the wallet looks nice (at least I hope my sister will think so) and the employee's at the store were incredibly nice. I have attached some photos to this review in order to show off my complaint. In order to be as fair as I can be I have taken them in my lightbox so that they can be seen easier.",MAKE Vancouver at Granville Island,I

2799,"Cool place to get custom designs printed (that doesn't have to be a bulk order). Their customer service is responsive and friendly, but I had a small issue with my custom order of tea towels.

I asked if it would come off in the washer and they weren't sure, so said they'd re-print and it would be ready in a few days. I had to make a second 30+ minute trip out to pick up the re-print as mailing it to me would have cost money. I wasn't thrilled about the additional trip, but the towels and coasters themselves turned out nice and are of decent quality!

Just wish there was a bit more quality control in checking the towels before telling customers their order is ready for pick-up (in case there are ink issues). I had even emailed for pictures ahead of time, which they kindly sent, but just of the design and not the whole towel. Would still recommend for custom items!",MAKE Vancouver at Granville Island,I

2846,"Had worked overtime to place a big order did not receive any updates so we assumed all was good, then we went out of town and our bank flagged a large transaction so cheque was blocked which our banker can confirm. We came back.only to find Stacy Nicole Hall the Business Owner wrote on our consignment business page and google review an awful unprofessional review without even resolving the matter with us. This is completely unprofessional and a bad case of slander as the order had NOTHING to do with our consignment business! She had disclosed private information on her disgusting review as well which is beyond comprehension from a business perspective! We also never received an email from them regarding this matter so we were absolutely NOT aware that there was even a problem with our order! We sent an email the day we returned after hearing msgs from our bank regarding a suspicious large transaction that needed our verification which we failed to verify on time so we immediately advised them that we will be coming in to pay in person yet she went out of her way to write us a very rude and awful review. Great customer service skills and what a way to problem solve! Very very disappointed! I would not order from them if you're a business, looks like they have zero patience and would go out of their way to slander your business! We had expressed the importance of this order and the deadline we were working with so we were NOT by any means avoiding or not paying for the order. It was simply lack of communication due to bad reception out of the country. The staff we worked with for the order were good but definitely not impressed with the owner! Do I have to worry about my copyrights to our print order too? Where's good old customer service? Shame on you Stacy Hall! Stacy Nicole we have email records (see photo) of your HR Manager Katy King apologizing on your behalf along with all your staff that were shocked of how you handled this matter, on the email it clearly stated that you will remove all posts regarding my business and you had left the google review posted for 2 months! We had paid our balance the next day we came back to town and you failed to keep your word! Remove your google post or legal action will be taken!",MAKE Vancouver at Granville Island,I

3039,"They will ""lose"" your order at least once. Some of the employees are rude and the store isn't very organized. Bring in your shirt is a must cause their shirts aren't breathable. Quality of the work is good considering everything you have to go through. If you can find another store that does this work, go there instead.",Mapleimprint,J
3040,"Ordered 20 shirts to be printed, was a rushed order so I can understand a slight to moderate decrease in quality as well as an increased price. What I do not understand is why almost all of the shirts ordered came stained. I'm not sure whether it is stained with bleach, or if the printing ink leaked off of the design and onto the fabric of the shirts, either way this is completely unacceptable for an almost $40/shirt order. I strongly suggest going elsewhere for having your shirts printed, as this company will not only deliver low quality, but will also ruin your shirts in the process with stains.",Mapleimprint,J

3058,"First time ordering a custom hoodie, tried this company since the price was right and reviews seem ok, though the final product did not turn out as intended.

First, the design tool preview is not a good representation of what you're getting. In fact, I don't think the person who makes the print even looks at the preview as mine was totally different. I asked them to hold off until I change the image to help them fix their problem, but they went ahead and edited my image instead and printed it.

The final product was not bad, but not exactly as designed since the image was edited poorly to fix their problem. I still ended up accepting the order since they put so much work into it. But overall I found my experience to be too much of a hassle, so I would not recommend.",Mapleimprint,J

3152,Very happy with the print quality and they delivered my order ahead of schedule. Not my first time looking for ottawa t-shirt printing but the last place I was using closed so I switched to Ottawa Shirt Printing and am very happy with my new t-shirt printer.,Ottawa Shirt Printing,L
3153,"I recently had shirts made for my father-in-laws 60th birthday. We ordered them on Saturday and they managed to have them ready by Tuesday evening (which was considered a rush order). There was a mistake with how the shirts were printed (there was no ""h"" on 60th birthday, so it read
""60 t birthday""). However, we brought it back to the place where we picked them up in Carlingwood mall and they fixed this within an hour, and were very apologetic.

Chris gave excellent customer service - he was responsive, patient and flexible. We are pleased with how the shirts came in, even better than what we expected.

My only other comment would be that the women's V-neck shirts fit on the smaller side. In street-clothes I'm typically a XS or S, and I ordered a Medium which fit perfectly. The men's crew neck shirts were true to size.

Overall, would highly recommend! Great work.",Ottawa Shirt Printing,L

Terry at Ottawa Custom Clothing was the only person who was willing to take on my order. Even though the original artwork I sent him needed to be updated he still had my order complete and shipped in the appropriate time and I received them before the event with time to spare! I am very pleased with my purchase and recommend this business, I will order again.",ottawacustomclothing,M
3283,"Initially good service but then no updates or notices when product was mailed out even after I emailed them for updates. Package was missing a shirt and now they are not answering my emails or calls. Do not order from them.

Update: after posting this review I was contacted to fix the mistake by another employee. I was hopeful at first but they are no longer answering emails asking for an update or refund (it's been a month since I heard from them). Don't shop here, not worth the effort to get what you paid for.",ottawacustomclothing,M
3284,"I put in a test order of $75 because of the negative reviews on Google. Sure enough, I had a bad experience.

Their budget went into the website to give it a professional design and features but all other aspects of this company are poor to say the least.

Customer service is either unresponsive or evasive. I didn't receive an e-mail (with tracking) when the items shipped, they just. shipped it. Prior to that, I've asked to do local pick up, was told yes, and they shipped it anyways. They used a Purolator bag to ship through Canada Post (not a big deal but rather strange).

I got the custom shirts and the quality is low compared to what you'd get elsewhere.

Save yourself the trouble, I went through it so you don't have to. You're welcome.",ottawacustomclothing,M
3285,"Never answers their calls or emails.

Ended up being over 50$ for two plain white t shirts with 1 logo on the front

Was supposed to come on Feb 3, ordered on january 18. we had to call them to remind them to ship it out. It finally came on Feb 10th. And they are the wrong sizes

Ridiculous",ottawacustomclothing,M

Way better than ordering from big chain manufacturers, you get to actually work with real people. If I could, I'd give 6/5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è",ottawacustomclothing,M
3287,"Not a great experience. Do not recommend.

Ordered placed mid-June for 8 t-shirts (4 adults, and 4 youths). At the time of order, I was given a July 1st estimate for shipping and my credit card was charged immediately. On July 5th I reached out via email to Ottawa Custom Clothing inquiring on the status of our order and received no response. Called on July 6th and reached someone on a cell phone who sounded like they were out for a walk. Was told during that phone call that they weren't at the office and couldn't help me and was told to email. Order was then received on July 7th. The adult shirts were ok but the 'ladies' version of the t-shirts were just the unisex, and not the correct sizes. The youth shirts brand and colour was substituted so they do not match the adult shirts. Ottawa Custom Clothing has not responded to emails or phone calls.

I'll chalk this one down as a loss and not use them again in the future.",ottawacustomclothing,M
3288,"*Updated Review after receiving order*

Order of 2 shirts finally arrived after nearly 2 months. They are as described but I feel I missed how they are made when I placed the order. I was expecting an embroidered logo, however they are simple iron-ons that literally take 5 minutes to print and apply. In that respect I am disappointed, but glad I have backup shirts for my VistaPrint ones.

Secondly, I was surprised that an Ottawa-based company doesn't produce locally. My order came from ""A Popular Company"" from Kazabazua, QC. After trying to find info on this company, I found nothing. Big red flag right there. I get the whole 3rd-party reselling but be transparent about this.

Lastly, I cannot excuse the complete lack of communication. I phoned twice and spoke with Terry who was nice and all, but never followed up with me. Customer service is extremely high importance so I hope there's improvement there.

All in all, I'm fine with my $130 purchase but this place definitely needs to improve if they want to succeed further. And I hope they do.",ottawacustomclothing,M

Im taking art and i wanted one of my designs on a sweater so i ordered from this place. Was suppose to get it March 2nd never got it emailed them and they told me it would be shipped out March 4th. I ordered it in February. It is not March 23rd and still nothing. I emailed them twice about a refund and how i dont want the order now and nothing.

I was happy to be supporting a local Ottawa company. I admit I was a bit worried after hitting a full voicemail box a couple times, and when the sample sweater took longer than expected to come.

Emailed with a follow-up - no answer. Finally, I emailed telling that I would be canceling the order and leaving a review on line.

All i can say is he met my expectations and beyond. I appreciate it OCC!,ottawacustomclothing,M
3296,"One month after the delivery date and my shirts never arrived, and there was no response to my emails or phone calls. I'm all for supporting small business, and understand that smaller operations can get overwhelmed.

I had to dispute the charge with my credit card company, just a big waste of time.",ottawacustomclothing,M

I have tried to inquire what is happening with my order through their website, through email, and by phone (there voicemail is too full to even leave a message), without any response. The customer service is poor. If you read any of the other reviews (which I regret not doing before ordering), you will notice many other reviews similar to mine (current and older ones too). I am just frustrated that they have taken my money without the delivery of goods and zero communications about what is happening. I hope to still see my product soon, but even still, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this company.",ottawacustomclothing,M
3298,"I placed my order through the website and this company was quick to email me back. Communication was great and professional. Because I ordered over 1000 shirts, hats, and hoodies, it took a few phone calls to iron out the details, but they were very patient with me.

From begining to end it was a positive experience. Delivery was on time, and the price was pretty good. Ottawa Custom Clothing will have my business again.",ottawacustomclothing,M
3299,"As of today (July 15th, 2021) the order placed on March 31st, 2021 has not been correctly fulfilled. A mistake was made on the printing of the majority of the order and while trying to resolve the issue, this company has been almost impossible to contact. The last email from the company was on May 25th, 2021 when they cited the reason behind the slow communication was because they had a big order. I'm sorry but every order should be treated with the same respect, and our order was not insignificant. I have tried calling and been met with a full voicemail. They have our money and we have unwearable items due to a misprint. I would take my business elsewhere, but they still have our money.",ottawacustomclothing,M
3300,I ordered 48 shirts from Ottawa Custom Clothing and they turned out beautifully. The staff member who assisted me was very helpful and patient when I was placing my order.

3301,"Ordered a shirt a month ago. Expected delivery October 22nd. Didn't show up. Called on the 28th. Person said they were doing a delivery and would check on the order when they got back home. No call back. Email, no answer. Check the status on my order number, page doesn't show up. Called two other times, no answer, full mailbox. Out $35. Local shops like this make Amazon look great. Beware of this scam.",ottawacustomclothing,M
3302,"UPDATE: I am STILL waiting for my missing T-Shirts (Currently August 16, 2017). No one is answering my phone calls so I am going through my Visa to dispute the charge. What a nightmare this experience has been!

I am still waiting on T-shirts from an order placed on May 30, 2017 (Currently July 21, 2017). They sent some but miscounted and left out 28 shirts. I have been trying to get the missing shirts for over a month. They are impossible to get a hold of and unbelievably unorganized. They told me the shirts have been shipped weeks ago but haven't been able to tell me with what company or provide a tracking number. Now they are no longer answering my emails or calls. Worst customer service experience I have ever had. I wish I had checked the reviews before using them because clearly I am not the only one who has been left out to dry by this terrible customer service. I would not recommend this company to anyone.",ottawacustomclothing,M

Very pleased with this service.",ottawacustomclothing,M
3305,"Terry, became very busy with the onset of Covid and received a crazy amount of orders. After receiving poor reviews he corrected, provided refunds, and hired on staff to make sure they got back to customers in a timely fashion. I would give them another shot for sure just because he reached back out to let me know of the changes.",ottawacustomclothing,M
3306,"My order was due last Friday, I have been trying to contact them by email and phone call and I have received no answer, now that I read the other reviews I guess this company is a scam, do not order from them, I wanted to support local but this is what I got for it. What a disappointing experience.

Update: I got an answer about my order, it wasn't placed yet, it was ""incomplete, due to back-order"" they gave me the option to actually send it or refund the money and I didn't want to take the risk so I asked for a refund and I received it, so it is not a scam, just a company with delayed deliveries and bad customer service",ottawacustomclothing,M
3307,"Throughout the span of a week I emailed twice and called twice (and left a message) but still no response on the order :/

Edit: After posting the review I got a call and discussed what was happening with the order..We cleared things up and the guy on the phone was nice but the fact that ordering from the website is only for artwork or that there's 2 emails was still confusing",ottawacustomclothing,M

3309,Despite some minor delay in the communication and delivery of my item I am satisfied with the service.

Thanks Terry for a great product!",ottawacustomclothing,M
3311,"I've read the other reviews and I'm honestly shocked with the way these people slander this company. Our company started doing charity runs 2 years ago and have ordered shirts from OCC 3 times. Large orders at that of 300+ shirts and not only did the owner go out of his way to make sure our order was correct he ended up hand delivering them to make sure they arrived for our event because of the postal strike.
Thanks OCC! Keep up the good work and we'll be talking to you next summer!",ottawacustomclothing,M
3312,"Had such a wonderful experience with Terry at Ottawa Custom Clothing. I needed some t shirts printed for a fundraiser in my art business, in a short amount of time and Terry not only managed to print them, but he delivered them as well.

Emailed over 20 times and only replied once. I left voice messages and still no reply.
Tried to cancel order but instead ignored all my 20 plus phone calls and 20 emails and just sent the shirts.
When they were delivered the shirts were the right size but i order three hoodies. 2 large and 1 small. They were delivered all medium. So can't use them at all..Tried to call to get it fixed and still no answer to calls or emails.
Will never do business again or recommend.",ottawacustomclothing,M

The quality of the shirts is great, the logos turned out really nice, and the colours are exactly what I expected. Every time I had a question or sent an email, I received a detailed answer right away. It's clear that the professionals at OCC take pride in what they do - I would definitely recommend them! Great prices too!",ottawacustomclothing,M
3315,"Great company, great quality on the t-shirts and tanks, and amazing customer service for communication inbetween. They met my deadline (which was not alot of notice) and the shirts arrived a week earlier than I anticipated, thank you thank you! I will be ordering again in future, and recommend OCC. Thank you so much for all your help Terry & your team.",ottawacustomclothing,M
3316,"Possibly one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had.

Ordered and paid for my shirts on June 21st, with a guarantee that they would be finished and delivered by the 30th.

I was then told that they wouldn't be delivered by then, but if I drove up to Wakefield, QC, I could get them the Saturday morning (July 1st).

Drove up there (About 45 mins one way) to a very messy looking house (with puppies that were left out in the rain all night.) alcohol bottles and wine glasses all over the front area of the house..A man came stumbling out shirtless, half asleep to tell me that they had been shipped out with Purolator on THURSDAY. Two days before I drove up. and no one could shoot me an email? Or give me a phone call?

After the weekend (since they were closed) I called Purolator to see where the package was. They told me that someone from Ottawa Custom Clothing had called them that DAY and told them to return the boxes to the shop in Wakefield!

After all of this trying to get ahold of someone again was a nightmare. Multiple unanswered phone calls and texts.

When I finally did get a hold of the company (days later) I was told that no one could drive the shirts out to me and they would have to be sent via Purolator again. I FINALLY received my shirts yesterday (July 6th) 6 days after the promised delivery date.

Nothing about this experience was professional or efficient. I will never be using this service again and will be advising others in the Ottawa business community to stay far, far away.",ottawacustomclothing,M
3317,"these guys have the worst customer service, they don't answer phone calls, they don't respond to voice mails, once you give them your money they stop caring. they were also 3months late on some shirts I ordered and during those 3 months of me trying to get in touch with them they responded back to me once and made promises they did not keep.

- took for ever to get an email reponse
- the phone number they provided, no one answers even when you leave VM
- terrible customer experience, main problem communication
- had to follow up multiple times to see if the logo was recieved, sizes were recieved and still no one got back to me
- when they got back to me they kept saying we are busy with other orders
- Do NOT negotiate price cause the owner will call you out that your nickel and diming him (owners words)
- my shipping date arrived but I never recieved anything so I emailed him back and he said I'm in the middle of the order and that it will take longer
- I never got any emails or phone calls to notify me where my order was to a point that I was following up",ottawacustomclothing,M

But more importantly i need it to be Reliable - On time, looking the same, and high quality - every time. And thats why a friend, and also small business owner, referred me to the gang @presstimedesign and im glad he did. Now, theyre the only ones ill deal with. Consistently knocking it out of the park. Its a relationship, that will grow along with the ups and downs of my small company.",Presstime Design & Screenprint,N
3450,"When they were in LA and they were a smaller company they used to be amazing. Now they are too big to be bothered to have decent enough customer service to make things work smoothly. The quality of the products is still pretty good, but every order that gets made has some sort of technical hang up now. And it takes forever to get through the customer service chain to anyone who can actually help. Two stars because I still do like the quality of their printing.",Printful,O
3451,"The first issue is the inferior quality of items and printing. We used and ordered a wide range of shirts, hoodies, sweat pants, water bottles, phone cases, jackets, and dozens of more items over the last 9 months. The product quality and printing were always inferior - faded and blurred even though their system assured the print quality and files were good.

The worst part has been dealing with them when multiple packages placed by various customers fail to arrive. They do nothing to track or notify of these events and then absolutely refuse to assist in any way to help resolve the issue. They refer you to a website that is in Chinese and proceeds to tell you that you're on your own from there since they have it marked that they sent it out.

After several customer complaints, we gave them the benefit of the doubt, but the same issue keeps reoccurring, and they refuse to help or support us. It has been one problem after another, and they refuse to take any accountability for assisting the customer using their platform.

In addition to these major issues, they have a bunch of hidden fees and price increases that they do not inform you of so we were actually losing money on many items even AFTER we marker them up 5-10%!

Again, we wanted and tried to make this service work and gave them more than enough chances to help us stay a customer. If SERVICE and quality are essential to you and your customers, you should avoid using Printful by all means necessary.",Printful,O
3452,"Terrible Quality Control..Their printing quality is bad for shirts, mugs and posters..I received my samples only to be disappointed. The shirts were printed poorly with no line definition. Same thing with the mug, cheap and poorly imprinted..The poster was also fiasco, it seems that they don't know how to use a plotter. Not one product was produce properly.
Quality control should a priority for you company, so your clients can receive quality products..If I received some of the products you sent me as a gift, I would be offended, it was that bad.",Printful,O
3453,"Easy to create and so many products to choose from, plus free designs and fonts available with free integration to major ecommerce platforms!

3454,"I love the material. You can wash it over 1000 times and it will never fade! The design I decided to put on it is so vibrant, even though it's just black and white. I love this skirt so much. It was also definitely true to size and fit me perfectly.",Printful,O

As a textile designer by trade- I wanted to make sure the colors reproduced true to my design. The design team was very clear on what I needed to do. The customer service team is AWESOME! Very responsive!
I plan to keep working with Printful for my online store!",Printful,O
3456,"After doing a ton research, Printful was the first company I tried for my online business. Now, after spending many months building my website and creating lots of products I have a fully functioning store with hundreds of options on apparel and accessories. In this time I have also looked into other companies and even tried a few, and I have come to the conclusion that Printful is the best option for someone like me that wants a full line of designs and products, but does not have capital to order inventory. They also seem to be the only truly free option where they only make money from you if you sell products!

Pros: There are no hidden fees and they don't charge you to integrate with other sites - like your own website, Amazon, Etsy, etc. Most of the products I have gotten have been really nice. The print and color quality on the all-over print products is really amazing! Plus, every sample I have ordered looks just like the mock-up, that's pretty unbelievable since they are print to order, then cut out, then sewn! For the most part the product integration is really good. You can design products on their mock-up generator and they are automatically synced to your website or another selling platform. One of the best things for me, since I am trying to grow my brand, is that they have the option for labels on many of the products. They also allow for multiple image layers - this is HUGE - so I don't have to tailor multiple images for multiple products. This also makes it possible to put specific size logos on products that do not have labels. I have also found that their customer service is really good! I have had problems with a couple orders and they have gotten back to me right away and rushed out replacements. Also, they have lots of informational videos for when you are first starting out. They also allow sellers to leave reviews and photos on all the products, this is very helpful when trying to decide what products to offer.

Cons: As I said above, for the most part the product integration is really good, when it works, it works great! But I have also had consistent problems with syncing. I will create products and they will sync up with my website just fine, then the next day they are not synced any more. Then I have to go in manually and re-sync each size and variation manually, which takes quite some time! This happens off and on so I do not know why it's happening and their tech support has not been very helpful for this problem despite many chats and emails. I have also had a few problems with the quality of a few of the products. I have ordered 2 hoodies and even though the hoodie itself seems to be really nice quality, the zippers have been bad. I have also changed some of my designs for regular print shirts since the ""DTG"" printing seems to be quite a bit softer and more fragile than screen printing. Then, there are just some products that are cost prohibitive to sell even though they look very nice - like the towels.

Overall, for me, the positives far outweigh the negatives, mostly due to the extremely high quality of their all-over print - rich vibrant colors. So, I decided to go with 5 starts. I had originally put 4 stars due to the cons I listed, but then I needed to weigh in the fact that the integration thing is a difficult intermittent problem and when compared to other companies, their tech support is probably better than most - at least there is one. So, even though I have had some issues with the integration, once everything is synced - it works GREAT! People make orders on my site and the order goes straight to Printful, then they make the product & ship it. The majority of their products are great and if there is a problem with a product, they will make it right. I highly recommend Printful.",Printful,O
3457,"What a great printing company, especially for beginners into the world of merchandise creation. There are plenty of tutorials and videos to help you get started. and so far all the products have looked great. I would like more product options however. Printful does have a huge list of products and none of their logos on your materials. But they could expand into other items, clothing, and features. Over all This place has been amazing!",Printful,O

3461,These Unisex Gildan sweatshirts are great. I wear mine every day and the design has still stayed perfect and clear.

3470,Very good quality t shirt. Ordered this as a trial product and am very happy with the results. The material quality is very good. Very nice soft cotton and comfortable to fit. The print is very good but is to be seen how well it stands up to several washes throughout a year. The size of the image could have been a bit bigger even though I used the full parameters given when I uploaded the design. The design looks a bit lost on an XL size Tshirt. Also I imagined the colours to be more vibrant but this is something I can most likely alter on future designs. Overall I'm very happy with the product.,Printful,O

3474,"Do not invest your startup money in doing business through Printful. False advertising to their sellers, customer support has no idea how to fix things, which goes to a different department, and there is no follow-up.

This order the print was too close to the collar (how it appears online is EXACTLY how it is so make sure to space it exactly how you want it because they don't adjust it to make it look good on their own)..Because of a miscommunication on that order they sent me another batch and this one was finally right..Great customer service, it just would've been nice to get everything right the first time. Nonetheless, I love Printful and think they do great work. Highly Recommend ëçèº",Printful,O

3486,"I'm a merchant who uses Printful as a printer and distributor. Their materials and quality of prints are amazing!

3488,"Regardless of policy or lack thereof, it baffles me when any company doesn't seek to make something right with their customers. In my case, I placed an order for a customer for some event specific shirts that shipped on time to arrive the day before the actual event, according to tracking. They arrived well after the event and weren't needed anymore. They never arrived for what they were intended for and I at least expected a refund upon returning the items. THAT ABSOLUTELY DIDN'T HAPPEN. In so many words, they basically told me, ""Whatever happens, happens"" after it's left their hands. Won't even accept a return. Refunded me the shipping but stuck me with $280 and a bunch of shirts that can't even be resold. I had to refund my customer, of course, but they were still made to look bad since they didn't have anything for the event. So my company's integrity takes a huge hit. Pockets take a $280 hit. And there's a $20 refund for shipping to show for it.

Way to go Printful Customer Service. Hell of a way to take care of your customers.",Printful,O

When I first started, the prices were a little bit high, and I wasn't making a lot of profit, but since it was just something extra for me, I wasn't in there for the profits.

Since I've stuck with them, their prices have gotten better as I'm sure their processes and distribution get better..I'm happy to stay with them and continue to use their services.

I love their mock-up service and can't wait to see what new features come out soon.",Printful,O
3491,"I got a refund for the ‚Äúcost‚Äù but it was damaging to my business and still don't feel comfortable moving forward with printful based on the lack of corrective action taken by printful to ensure me that it doesn't happen again.

This is serious, you can't sell products that are received by the customer in a different size than advertised‚Äî ‚Äú3X is 52in‚Äù and ‚ÄúMed is 39in‚Äù but they received the 3X at 48in and the medium was 35in. The size chart was not corrected and there was no indication that the situation was investigated and corrected so why would anyone continue doing business with printful.

I hope printful can figure out how to correct this, but I am still not comfortable moving forward with printful at this time.

So previously I stated the following.
‚ÄúIf printful corrects this issue with the sizes and refunds at least partially for my losses this review will reflect those actions‚Äî until then I highly do not recommend using printful.‚Äù. and still don't recommend doing business with printful.

I can make a FULL SHIRT design - front and back! - and have it produced rather than being limited to a 12x20 box on the front only. Printing and shipping takes about 7 days total for the package to arrive at your door. Not bad at all for designs that are unique and cost-effective!

Mainly because Printful doesn't know how to deal with technical issues. Without any reasons, without any explanations all my Woocommerce store has been unsynchronised to my Printful store. Result: I lost all my work, with unique descriptions and arts. When I ask at the Printful support some assistance the answer was simple : ""You need to do it again"".
I won't upload all my products again, for me it's Printful responsibility to guaranty the correct integration with Woocommerce, specially when they're doing updates. I don't want to be in the situation to have everything unsynchronised again because Printful plugin is not working properly with the Woocommerce update.",Printful,O
3506,"I've been working with Printful for less than a year, selling a few mugs and such on Etsy..So far, it's been a very positive experience, and I am looking forward to trying out more and more of their products in conjunction with my original designs.",Printful,O
3507,Printful is my go to DTG printer. Their products and customer service are fantastic! Definitely recommend.,Printful,O
3508,"I've made several shirts through Printful and each time the quality and price have impresssed me! The website is easy to use, and the fact that I can order a product and know right off the bat how much it will cost is a big time-saver. I'd highly recommend it!",Printful,O
3509,"Not a good selection if looking to start your business using this company..They do not always update out of stock items, leaving customers guessing why fulfillment is taking so long. There integration with Zakeke is not well thought out. They allow customers to place orders with images much too small and with non-allowable content. They do not inform the store of this, so again it seems as though there is a delay of fulfillment when there is actually no intent to fulfill. Their product is cheap..The shirt sizes run small and the print is not full..Within a few washes it will bleed out.",Printful,O
3510,"Absolutely do not use this company for bulk orders..On November 26 I manually placed an order for my customer for 100 tote bags..At the suggestion of customer service I opted for screen printing because my design was simple and the price would be less than DTG..The total was $1297 or $1,389.72 after shipping..I waited a week but there was no movement on the order..I checked again and then I saw a restocking notice on the order..I contacted customer service, but they assured me that since it was within the fulfillment window, I should not worry as the totes would be restocked soon..I waited for another week, contacted customer service and again I was told not to worry..I was nervous that my customer would not receive the bags in time so I paid extra for expedited shipping..A day before the fulfillment window was up on Dec 13, I called and finally was ‚Äúhelped‚Äù..I was told that the totes were still out of stock and they were ordered to the fulfillment center on December 7 (I placed my order on Nov 26)..At that point I was in danger of losing a huge sale so I asked if they could switch my order to DTG.(bags were in stock in LA) and have it printed and shipped ASAP since my customer needed them a week ago..I would expect that since the extreme delay was not my fault, they would charge me the same amount as screen printing but instead they charged me the DTG rate of $1504.25 including shipping..So because of Printful's error I had to take money out of my small profit..Their Etsy integration for single individual orders is great but do not use them for bulk orders and do not trust that their customer service decisions are in your best interest.",Printful,O
3511,"As retailers what sets us apart from our competition is our quality, our price, and our service. Printful understands this and recognizes that the bottom line is not everything and they always provide great quality and their service is almost always fantastic.By the way Michael D. whoever you are, you are the man and you epitomize the customer service of Printful. Thank you!",Printful,O
3512,The shirt I ordered was exactly as I wanted. A nice quality/weight material. Not thin and see through like some..‚ô°.So glad Printful offers the Bella and Canvas 3001 shirt..‚ô°,Printful,O
3513,"Printful Provides a decent service with many items to choose from. Their website is very user friendly but they need to do some work on their All-Over Sublimation Prints. The printed areas around the seams of the shirt and underneath the armpits are very cheaply done. In particular, the American Apparel Sublimation Shirt. The prices on all products could be better. And they could provide a much better variety of mockup images at higher resolutions. The are very few mockup images available for many of the products, and the mockup images that you get from their mockup generator aren't even large enough for Etsy's minimum pixel width requirements. If they really cared about selling their products they would spend more time on mockup images for those of us selling print on demand items. All in all, they are not the worst company to in the POD game but they definitely need work!",Printful,O
3514,"printful, I.highly recommend this print on demand company as a new and just started online store they help me all the way and they fullfill the order fast so those who are planning to do online store PRINTFUL is highly recommended as your dropshipping company for printing. thanks for the smooth ride",Printful,O

3516,"Inconsistent quality and refusal to refund or replace..My logo was perfect the first 2 orders, the 3rd order it arrived glossy and pixelated looking like a cheap iron-on. Customer service blamed my image which is the same image that is in my online library which was used for the 1st and 2nd order.",Printful,O
3517,Working as an independent artist along with running your own business can be a daunting task. Printful helps me do much more than I could ever do on my own while empowering me as a creative to see what pieces are doing well along with saving me time and money by not having spend so much to keep large quantities of prints in stock. Grateful for this service.,Printful,O
3518,"Printful has given me some excellent ideas of ways to extend my product lines and share works I have created in a variety of formats / prints - with little or no administrative input from me after the the initial setup..A very helpful service, especially since they provide fulfilment from within the EU.",Printful,O

3522,"Great shorts for any sport. I use them personally for very hard squash matches, a sport that generates a ton of sweat.

3525,"I've Printed Men's and Women's All Over Print Shirts, Canvas, Pillows, Phone Cases, Leggings, and everything has come out great! Really incredible how they can print in RGB over CMYK. Allows for the colors to POP.",Printful,O
3526,"A small business owner who will never use Printful again. Time is too short to have to call customer service mutliple times on behalf a small order of custom embrioderd hats..It should be easy - that's why I.chose to use an online printer for this project..They have also outsourced some of their cusotmer sevrice to Europe which I find odd..I will continue using CustomInk, UPrinting and Vistaprint over Printful.",Printful,O
3527,"This is the best shirts ever! Not only do i agree with that but all of my customers do. It is great quality, and super soft! I keep getting more and more comments on how great it is! And when you have $8,000 in sales in 3 days, that proves it!",Printful,O
3528,"I'm working on taking my business elsewhere. I don't know how they could get any worse. They are great at printing my designs completely crooked or a completely wrong design, twice where it wasn't even my design they printed. There is no quality control. They also are great at inconsistency. Sometimes they tell me X and other times they tell me Y. Stay away before they hurt your business.",Printful,O
3529,"Poor Customer Service. My order was placed on hold and they never sent me an email. I asked if I could pick up two shirts from the location, they said no. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.They don't care about small business owners..If you're in business, they will negatively impact good service to your customers",Printful,O
3530,"Please heed the warnings. The quality control here is non existent. I have had 10+ separate, documented issues that are egregious and inexcusable. My brand has suffered terribly. Customer service is TERRIBLE and never accepts responsibility. Look elsewhere for quality and pricing.",Printful,O
3531,Not the best place to do business. They'll charge you double for orders or add fees on without you noticing. Best practice is to keep track of everything. Don't expect a refund when they're in the wrong. They charged me twice for a digitization fee.,Printful,O

However, when I went to get some prints completed, they were cut off in a way that was interfering with the picture. Not a big deal, as mistakes can happen, but when I asked to have them replaced, the replacement product was even worse, very washed out and with uneven borders. Not happy. I definitely wouldn't recommend coming here to get any pictures printed.",Printwell Custom Printing Ottawa,P

Liv followed up on things, checking to see if the masks were to our liking.

When it comes to the website and being user friendly I have to say it was !Flawless! Simple, easy to understand, and love that I can visualize my shirts prior to ordering (unlike the vendor I've been using). So excited to be using this platform more in the future!

Shout out to the Best CEO on the planet! Dru is so kind and actually cares about his company and employees. He contacted me directly after placing my first order to make sure I was happy with the way things went.

I have yet to receive the final product so unfortunately I am unable to share a photo of the results, but I have high hopes that the final product will blow it out of the park, just like these guys!

Highly recommend this company!

Thanks for all your hard work Team!

3920,"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!

For our 4th Annual Hackathon we knew we needed t-shirts that went above and beyond. We wanted gradients, front and back multi-color printing, and our logo on the sleeve. Definitely a tough order, but the cherry on top? We wanted them to glow under black lights, not something your everyday printer can do.

Well, Real Thread can.

Tiff and the team there are incredible helping us through the process and making sure everything was perfect (including blacklight sensitive gradients), accommodating crazy last-minute sponsor changes, and through it all getting us incredible, super soft, shirts for a great price. I honestly cannot praise them enough.

No matter what your project is, if you need shirts, talk to Real Thread.

You'll be hearing from me again soon,

But the true excellence is once the procurement process starts. Communications are quick and clear. I love the ability to view the mockups and they were made QUICKLY. Adjustments are easy to make and quickly, almost instantly applied. And for me the ability to divide the payments into two was vital. My only complaint is that you don't offer PUFF PRINTING! haha.

A thousand thanks!",Real Thread,Q

And I'm glad I did! I am not exaggerating at all when I say that they are by far better than any other printer I have ordered from. I spoke with Rob via email and he was always super friendly and super fast. The ordering process was really impressive. I was able to view and modify my quote online as well as easily track the status of my order..The shirts turned out exactly how I wanted. And to top it all off, Real Thread gave me the cheapest quote of all the other vendors I quoted. I did not experience one single problem or negative thing.

Employees and clients love the look and quality of the materials and Real Thread has great customer service. I had a pretty significant problem with one order because I used an email chain from a far older order to initiate a new order, which caused some confusion. Even though it was certainly not entirely Real Thread's fault that the order was incorrect they made it right, immediately, which doesn't happen very often anymore.",Real Thread,Q

3987,"Joey called to made sure he knew exactly what I was wanting, and even put a rush on the mock-up because the item I wanted to print on was low in stock. Haven't received my merch, yet, but have no doubt it'll be exactly what I'm expecting because their mock-ups and descriptions are so detailed. I've had a lot of bad experiences with printing one particular (over the zipper) design, so it was a breath of fresh air when Joey took the time to go over ever possible printing limitation, and make sure I knew exactly what to expect.",Real Thread,Q

FIVE STARS all around for Real Thread!",Real Thread,Q
3995,"Very personable interaction, I did not feel like just a number.

All my questions were answered quickly and I love the website interface.",Real Thread,Q

Joey took the reigns after Melanie had que'd up everything I wanted, and Joey seamlessly maintained my confidence and his correspondence was just as swift and helpful.

I'm the manager of an IT team at a large New York City hospital and we wanted to have cotton masks with one of our corporate mottoes to use when we're at patient facilities. They'll go over the surgical masks that they give us to wear on site. They'll will be much more stylish and help protect the surgical masks which are easily stained and damaged. They also help us send a message to our patients: we put them first.

These masks are very well made: the materials are good and the sewing is well done. The printing is excellent and the colors exactly right.",Real Thread,Q

We found Real Thread online but was hesitant as we'd be working with them from across the country. Our hesitations were soon dismissed. From their genuine/responsive customer service, quality prints, ordering process, supplementary services (poly bagging, hem tag stitching, size stickers, etc), we couldn't be happier with their service! Working with them has really made our product creation process SO much easier. Can't recommend them enough. I worked exclusively with Tiff, and could really tell that she's sincere with her correspondence and service.",Real Thread,Q

The ordering process was clear, and the digital mock-ups were terrific. The t-shirts arrived on time and we were all stoked about the print quality. Kudos to the RealThread team!",Real Thread,Q

4058,"I hadn't worked with Joey, he was helpful and when I asked about net 30 terms, the turn around was great..He answered all my questions as needed.",Real Thread,Q
4059,"So Real Thread had a couple hiccups with my order at first, after 5 days past the estimated delivery date I sent an email to check the status of the order seeing that the order was still at the burning screen stage on their website, I'm not sure what the details are of why it was stuck in this stage whether it human error or if they were overbooked and taking a while to get to it. Either way they responded with haste and had my order moving again. They gave me free next day shipping.and Credit because of it, then they informed me some of the sweatshirts had defects and didn't pass QC giving me an option reprinting the sweatshirts or credit for it, sometimes when it rains it pours. So with Hiccups you might be wondering why did I choose 5 stars still? Everyone and every company makes mistakes, regardless of how hard you try to manage them from happening,.yet when they happen how you choose to handle them is where your business can rise or fall. They definitely earned the 5 stars with their handling of the situation without me having to ask for anything extra because of the hiccups. I will be more than happy to bring them my business even after my credit with them is spent. Also the shirts and sweatshirts look phenomenal thank you Joey and Liv and the rest of the staff at RT for the awesome apparel and top notch customer service. -Integrity Seamless Gutters",Real Thread,Q

They did a marvelous job on t-shirts for our program--in fact, they are the most comfortable t-shirts that I own and have heard the same thing from numerous people who have received one. The screen-printing and material looks just like new despite 60+ times wearing and washing them. I recently purchased some masks with our company logo and they were affordable, comfortable, and well-made. I cannot recommend Real Thread highly enough. They have competitive pricing, quick response time, fantastic design work, and high-quality materials. They are my #1 go to when I'm considering promotional clothing, screen-printing, or stitch-work.",Real Thread,Q

4063,I spent about a month looking at tshirt companies online during Covid-19 and picked these guys/gals due to their reviews and due to the fact they could print inside the neck tag. I'm glad I did.

Everyone who works there is good at their job and is part of the reason the company thrives. I saw time and time again how they were able to produce a product most other shops would be envious of.

I even had the pleasure of being a customer and receiving one of the best shirts I've ever helped come up with. Across the board, from how the sales reps handled it, to the design I asked to make, to the person mixing the inks and burning the screens, to one of their many talented screen printers, all the way to the finishing department where they were nicely tucked away in a brand new box with the quantity and a picture of my shirt on the box.

4346,"Made about 20 shirts for a soon to be retired accountant. Simple design, one color. They turned out great. Amazed at how fast they arrived. Will be using them again to make shirts this summer. Price was about the same as other sites but they carried performance American Apparel in the sizes that I needed. 100% satisfied with the product.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4347,"I gave these guys another chance and they fumbled, big time. In one photo you can see the seems not properly stitched. In the other, you can see the printed wording beginning to crumble.

The thing is, one of their staff called me and offered to refund the cost of the shirt and provide one for free. I said that's cool. When the new (""higher quality"") shirt arrived I was happy . until the wording started to come off (after one wash!). It embarrassed me, frankly.

All along the staff told me the quality of the shirts was not the company's responsibility. (Tell that to Elon Musk about the batteries in his cars.) Well, that leaves the writing on the shirts left . and, it sucks.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4348,"UPDATE the company contacted me and offered to make it right. Very rare today for a company to take responsibility for their mistake and credit their client. Will absolutely use this company again and sing their praises. great job!

This review is a few months in the making. Ordered seven navy sweatshirts in December for our family vacation. We were excited to get a family photo with everyone in navy and white nautical theme. The order came in a timely fashion as I did pay extra for rush.

Well five of the sweatshirts were great, print was nice and material was just what we ordered, hence the two stars.

I took off stars for the men's 2XL sweatshirts. Never were we told they would be completely different then the rest of the order, they were labeled navy but are really royal blue. Additionally, they were for my 6'3 husband and son, they aren't heavy, just tall so we bought the larger size to give ten length, and paid about $55 each yet they literally looked like they were wearing children's sweatshirts because as well as the color being off, the material was cheaper and they were so short (think crop top) in length and in arms that the sweatshirts came up to their forearms.

We could have dealt with the color difference even though we wanted everyone matching, so we packed them to take with us for photos anyway as there was no time for new ones to be shipped before we left the country but the size disparity was ridiculous and just poor quality control for the amount of money spent.

Needless to say we didn't get a family photo because they wouldn't wear them. Such a waste of money. In this photo I made my son put it in just to show the color difference and how short the sleeves are. Crazy",Rush Order Tees ,R
4349,DO NOT order from this company. we bought around 20 t-shirt for our team and the color is completely different than what was shown on their website. We ordered tan color and got yellow. Such a waste of our money. All the team is disappointed. We contacted the company and they offered a discount of 20% off if we rebuy 20 new t-shirt in another color. Just so that we can waste more money on this company with poor costumer service. Here is a picture of the difference,Rush Order Tees ,R
4350,"Absolutely outstanding customer service! Super reasonable pricing, quick shipping and quality products! I have used them for VARIOUS projects and will continue to! AND their shirts made the front cover of our local paper!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4351,"I had a custom t-shirt order that was initially cancelled due to potential logo copyright infringement, which was understandable. I sent a follow-up email providing approval of my use of the logo, and then I followed up via RushOrderTees chat. I was put in touch with Luke L. and he handled my situation seamlessly. He was professional, friendly, efficient, and communicated very clearly. Bravo. This has been my second order with them, and after a great customer service experience (which is not as common as one would hope), it won't be my last order. Thanks again!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4352,"Okay so I'm leaving 5 stars as I believe it's well deserved
I ordered 4 shirts so far just to test the waters on this company. All 4 shirts are what I expected except that I had an issue with a 2 XL being disproportionate to the print size.

I called the company who is sending me the correct shirt and I feel confident at this point that this place is reputable.

Other than that I'm very pleased with the quality and customer service.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4353,"I had such a great experience ordering from RushOrderTees! It was really cool to be able to create a custom design. The website made it super intuitive so I could do it quickly, but I also enjoyed playing around with the design a bit. Communication was great and my shipment came earlier than I expected which was a nice surprise. I love the shirts we ordered and will definitely be ordering from RushOrderTees again!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4354,"Luke L. rocked my world on the RushOrderTees chat yesterday. I had placed a very last-minute order and he made sure the proofs got to me quick, the stock got there, and that it all got done and printed to be shipped out in time.

I've used RushOrderTees at least a dozen times and it's like magic. If you call or chat online, their employees are friendly, competent and willing/able to push to meet a deadline. Love it.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4355,"I used Rush order tees to get shirts for our churches production team and they were fantastic. Prices were a little bit cheaper than most other places I priced out. After I placed the order, 2 more people got back to me about ordering and I was able to add on to the order no problem. They were very helpful a nice about it. Also, the sweatshirt I had selected was out of stock and they upgraded me to another brand for free! Also the entire process took about 2 weeks from when I ordered to when they came which is super fast in my opinion! I just approved the proofs yesterday and they shipped that day and got here today. Will definitely recommend them and use them again!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4356,"I've ordered from RushOrderTees three times now and will definitely continue to use them for my custom clothing. My most recent order had a very intricate design, and I was not satisfied with the original shirts they sent me. When I reached out to customer service, they responded immediately and didn't hesitate to make changes to the design to make me fully satisfied. After numerous orders, things aren't always perfect, but their responsiveness and willingness to make things right shows that this is a customer first company!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4357,"RushOrderTees has been fantastic to work with! I have had to contact customer service on different occasions for different orders and they are always polite and handle my issues/questions quickly and make everything a breeze.

Outstanding service and refreshing how they took time to LISTEN to my needs. Definitely will be my one and only choice going forward for my printing needs. Thank you RushOrderTees!,Rush Order Tees ,R
4359,"Awesome service, super user friendly, amazing variety and they probably have the most customizable clothing out of all the sites and services I've used offering printing almost anywhere on the garment. I was particularly having a hard time finding a company that was willing to let me order a single sample with full color prints going down the sleeves and these guys not only made it possible but waived the extra printing fee for the sleeves on the sample I ordered. 5 stars, will absolutely be coming back when I have all the kinks worked out of my prototypes",Rush Order Tees ,R
4360,"I was really happy with the ordering process it was easy to use and had a lot of nice options. The finished product was great. I did have an issue with one of the sizes I received but I did not verify if it was my fault or the company's. I got a youth XL when I needed an adult XL. But the other three T shirts were perfect! Either way, the company fixed the problem by getting another sent immediately. I didn't even have to call and hassle with customer service, I just sent a quick email and that's all it took.

We had a few sweatshirts out of our bulk order come in with odd pockets on the front, and after filing a claim, they urgently took care of our problem and are sending us replacements for the sweatshirts. Their level of quality in product and customer service is unlike anything I've ever seen. Kaha Apparel is a HUGE fan of RushOrderTees!",Rush Order Tees ,R

4367,Very responsive when I sent a chat in with a question to ease my nerves that there may be something wrong with my order as it has been in art review for days. My order is still on schedule for the promised delivery time and almost ready for production. Can't wait to receive my shirts.,Rush Order Tees ,R
4368,"I recently started to teach Kenpo Karate again and decided to reconstruct my logo, name (Saber Strike Kenpo Karate) and philosophy and decided to go all in with posters, business cards, flyers, banners patches etc. I also chose to get T-shirts with my logo on front and back with additional graphics on the sleeves too.

The first order had some issues with the ink quality, coloring and sleeve length issues for the adult smalls. The youth large and youth XL sleeves were even longer than the adult small. However, this was a manufacturing issue by Gildan (G200) they were the ones that made the shirts. Rush Order Tees just prints on them and cannot control the quality of the shirts which is why it is nice that they have a huge selection to pick from. (I ended up using the Next Level Apparel for the do-overs.) I had 2 different t-shirts made for the original order, everything identical between them except the back graphics. Half of the order had mismatched colors from the front to back graphics and the ink began to wear off the other half of the order that seemed to be ok. I sold some of the shirts I thought were ok and stopped when my clients reported back they were seeing the ink wear off the shirts after normal wear and a few washes.

These shirts were printed using the Direct to Garment method and looked great other than the already mentioned issues but I can completely understand that not everything always goes to plan in a manufacturing environment from working in a manufacturing environment myself. Nothing to get upset about since this was my first time dealing with t-shirts and it was obvious that something had happened with the quality of the ink or the process.The fact that Rush Order Tees was not only willing to fix this order but wanted to do it as soon as they could displays a solid business ethic that others would do well to model in their corporations. Quality the first time around is just as important as the company wanting to immediately correct and issue or oversight the 2nd time around, which still equates to an A+ in my book. Nothing wrong with a do-over especially when they do as promised or even better in my case!

Either way Rush Order had Alyssa Seiders handle the issue for me. She was great, understanding and really came through to ensure the reprinted shirts were even better than I expected. My shirts had up to 8 colors which was complicated to begin with and when I requested for the screen print option over the Direct to Garment method they recommended I increase the quantity of the shirts in the order to better suit the production needs which I though was fair also coming from a production environment. I trusted they would come through and they DEFINITELY did! My students are excited to get their new shirts as well as the parents and many others that have been waiting to receive them. I am already working on my next few waves of shirts and understand exactly what to ask for in the future when printing on darker colors as well as how to utilize the screen printing over the DTG method when ordering by large quantities.

Thank you Alyssa and to Dean Ridgeway as well who filled in a couple of times when Alyssa was on vacation or unavailable! Great teamwork!",Rush Order Tees ,R

4379,"Let me start off by saying, this is an edit to my original review.

I ordered a Gildan brand t-shirt but received a different brand. The print work was great, just not the right shirt. I called to inform them of the problem. This was after 5pm central time. The representative I spoke to was argumentative but I was told I would receive a call back. I'm not sure if it's because of the Holidays but, the call back took a little longer than what I was told. I will say, I was completely done with this company untill I spoke to a very understanding and friendly woman named Laura. Laura is by definition of what customer service should be about. Because of my conversation with her, I have decided to change my review. I hope to do more business with them in the future.
2nd edit:
I have received my shirt and it looks great. The print work is great, size and location is exactly where I wanted it to be. Very pleased with work.",Rush Order Tees ,R

I called Rush order about this, and they were able to print the shirts same day and I was able to pick them up. Now I'm sure this is not the norm, but customer service was absolutely amazing.

First they altered my image I sent to something I didn't want at all and was completely unnecessary.

I picked up Jerzees Nublend Pullover Hoodie, A4 Moisture Wicking Long Sleeve Shirt and 3600 Next Level Apparel Crewneck T-Shirt. I'm impressed by the fit and material of all three. The fit is just as I expected and wanted. The print job came out perfect, but the material and shirt quality are definitely what led me here to leave a review.

4392,"My experience started with us ordering the tshirts that they told me were in stock and then no actually having them in stock and delaying production. They then self approved our art and went on to print tshirts that were incorrect and quickly shipped to us even though i had contacted them to tell them we had no approved the art. It takes forever for them to respond when theres an issue and in the end never solved it and we have been left with a bunch of tshirts that cant be used and no refund. If you're just looking for some blah quality product rush order tees is for you. They pretend its personalized service but its another bulk, low quality with little attention to detail tshirt making factory. NEVER AGAIN.

Edited: I see the owners response below. You're right! We had communication since august because nothing was resolved, and once again, with your response here nothing is being resolved. ""I will make sure to escalate this to management to make improvements going forward"" but, you still wont solve our issue nor refund our order. Once more: NEVER AGAIN!",Rush Order Tees ,R

Fortunately I had a great customer service member that guided me through the process and gracefully showed me where I made the mistake, òî..Since it was a Christmas gift for my beautiful wife, I was prepared for the ""to bad"" pay anyways. This is where I feel ROT's went way beyond customer service at a cost to them and not me, went ahead and sent the proper order, though against ROT's policy, they did it anyway. ROT's isn't a company for anything free, especially if the customer makes the mistake, they did everything right. I am more than thankful ! ôå òå and my beautiful wife loves her gift.

When I need an order in a rush, they hit the deadline..There was an issue during covid and there have been supply chain issues in the industry itself, so it's understandable if something happens here and there, but if they say they're going to deliver on time, they will deliver unlike most other companies that put me in the back of the line..Delivering custom t-shirts in 1 or 2 days. it's been a life saver.",Rush Order Tees ,R

Bonus points for the customer care team for being super patient and helpful in reassuring me they would make it in time each time I called.

4421,"Horrible experience. I had a rush order for 12 t-shirts that was a last minute need. I couldn't get them locally in time so ordered them from RushOrder.

I paid over $40 per shirt/ including shipping because I needed them in two days. I gave myself an extra day, just to be safe. I never received any messages from them through the process so I had to watch the website anxiously to see if they were coming on time.

They did not arrive on the day they were supposed to, but by the time my delivery person had come, it was too late to do anything that night. I called first thing the next morning and one day before my event. I was told they were printing that day and would be shipped. I knew they could not get them across the country in that little time, the guy I spoke to asked me to please give him a chance to try something that might work. He never called me back!

I called again and got another representative, she told me they were still in printing and wouldn't be received until Monday- almost 1 week after I ordered them! That would be 2 days late and I would have nothing for my event. I am left with less than 24 hours to come up with my own solution. If I had one, I would have done it 4 days ago instead of ordering from them at such a high price!

I was transferred to their Alyssa who offered to refund 50% of my order. After, I explained my anger, she offered me a full refund and free shipping of the shirts. I'm not really sure what I am supposed to do with them now? I was impressed with Alyssa and she did her best to fix an unfixable situation. At least if I get the shirts I will know that somebody at this company cares. I will never order from them again and would suggest that you think carefully about what you will do if they don't live up to their promise. Have a back-up plan!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4422,"Unfortunately, I'm super disappointed. I was so excited to find a shop that could turn around my order so quickly. BUT one thing they were very misleading about is that under the tag of every single t-shirt they would be printing their large ""Rush Order Tees"" logo - without permission. And when I initially ordered over the phone, I communicated to the rep that I was looking for tagless t-shirts, wouldn't this be the time to mention your logo? He still went on to place my order and mentioned nothing about the branding that would literally make every single t-shirt look tacky. I work for a music artist and this is not even something we would sell to his fans. I'm just super disappointed that the rep was misleading about this.

The screenprinting is great! It arrived on time, BUT so many other shops can provide both of these things - so I give one star for misleading your customers. I find it very unprofessional. I'm sure there are many more customers who didn't expect your branding to be on products that we paid for.

I will update my review soon to explain how customer service handles this.

Update. This update is long over due. Customer service handled the situation like champs. They replaced our entire order, suggesting we keep the misprints. And to this day, the screen printing on these shirts is the best quality that we've come across. I'm not kidding. We've been also using Printful for our on demand orders (printful quality has diminished over the last year sadly). Yesterday I found myself recommending RushOrder Tees because of how on point their quality in printing is, and of course the turn around time. Our last order of black tees with white screenprint is bold and will last many many years, where as Printful's quality wears after the 1st wash. It was a little bit of a rough start with RushOrder BUT you can't beat the quality! So thank you for that.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4423,"The website lies about when your product will be shipped and printed. Inaccurate tracking. Doesn't matter how quickly art is approved they take forever to ship. ‚ÄúRush order‚Äù but they obviously have no intentions to be fast. Super Overpriced shipping fees. The chat doesn't work on the website, never connects you to an agent. The email customer service is unhelpful and rude. It'd be quicker to go into a mall and get custom clothes made then to shop here.

Update: customer service got to me after leaving this review and my hoodie was printed and delivered today. Wasn't the best quality printing for how long it took to arrive and how pretty basic the printing looks, also some of the image was not printed so it looks kind of like some of the image they forgot to print or was cut off. Nevertheless I think it looks sort of distressed and I have no intentions to return. I stand on my point of going into a mall, it will be def faster, better quality and cheaper. They charge way too much money for a print job that looks like I did it with an at home printer and iron.",Rush Order Tees ,R

4455,"We ordered several work T shirts from Rush Order tees. They were the last piece of the puzzle and were meant to really tie everyone together. Making everyone look the same. Professional and uniform. The shirts (even though I received an email about them being delayed) arrived very quickly and the entire order process including designing the shirts was very easy to do. The shirts looked perfect when they arrived and we were stylin and profylin. Unfortunately not 7 months later the logo, company name and phone number were fading. I mean completely on a couple, mostly on another couple it was enough to make me reach out to the company just to mention it. I really didn't expect much and truthfully I don't know the life expectancy for this type of shirt. Maybe it was only 2 months and these shirts lasted an incredible amount of time. Not so. One email describing my problem and Rush Order Tees was all over it. Without hesitation they are reprinting and resending out my entire order. BOOM. this is how companies should do business. When Rush Order Tees says Great Product Great Service & Great People in their logo. well it's the truth. These people aren't working in some sweatshop in Bangladesh (I don't think) they are here helping their customers design great looking stuff and backing their product all the way to the bank.

4458,"UPDATE: They followed up and initially refunded the rush shipping fee. When we missed our deadline for the project, they refunded the remaining balance. When the shirts did arrive, the print quality was very good, as was the shirt quality (Next Level). Despite my initial frustration, I do feel they made an earnest effort to correct the situation, so I've updated my initial 1-star review accordingly.

We paid $70 for the fastest rush shipping option on a very time-sensitive job (and the ability to hit the deadline was the entire reason for using Rush Order Tees). The delivery date specified during the ordering process was 9/14. After checkout, they quietly changed the delivery date to 9/16.

About 2 weeks before we were set to leave I got the bright idea to order shirts for everyone for the celebration. I kept telling myself I wished I'd thought of the idea sooner, but I would somehow make it work. Thanks to Josh and Nathan at Rush Order Tees the surprise went off without any issues or glitches and everyone loved their shirts! They helped me get my order placed AND rushed the delivery so I would receive them before we departed for North Carolina. I can't say enough about how great this experience was.

4479,"I ordered a hoodie that was 60 dollars (!) but I liked the design I had made so I ordered despite the price. The day the order was marked as delivered I was excited but the package wasn't anywhere to be found. I called customer service and they told me they could reprint my hoodie on a different brand of hoodie. I didn't want that and requested a refund and was told it's not an option for the representative. I asked if there would be an issue if I disputed it with my bank and the agent said ‚Äúwe have proof of delivery so we would dispute it‚Äù. Unbelievable robbery of my money and rude customer service.

edit: don't think just because they responded to my review they solved my problem. all they did was once again offer me the same design in a different color. will not be using their services again, and i strongly advice you to not as well as they can literally steal your money.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4480,"Spent almost $200 on 1 hoodie and 3 shirts and all the shirts were horribly done. Its almost as if they take the name of the brand RUSHordertees literally and they rush everything to the point where it comes out horrible. The logo i wanted on the garments were so low they were pretty much printed on the stomach area of the shirts and hoodie instead of the middle chest area and the logo i wanted on them were crooked and the garments were just completely unwearable. On top of that i ordered a medium hoodie and recieved an XL instead. They are reprinting them so when i have the repirints i will update this with how they come out. This isnt the first order i had like this from this company. Seem they need to take more pride in their work instead of literally rushing everything. And maybe check the work before just packing it up and shipping it out like its all good. People are spending a lot of money on this stuff.

Update: I got my reprints and they came in absolutely perfect just the way i was expecting them to the first time. I will soon be making a bigger order and i just wanted to make sure they were going to be perfect before putting that order in. RushOrderTees customer servicr is on point.

Both times I called because it was close to delivery date but I was not given a shipping number yet. I was told order was on schedule. a few days after the were supposed to be delivered I emailed customer service and was I told they looked into it and they are behind. It would be completed and shipped sometime next week. I only wish they were upfront about being behind schedule from the beginning and I could have made other arrangements. I do not recommend using them anymore as I did after the first order last year. Going to try somewhere local next time.,Rush Order Tees ,R

The guy was super nice and picked out the perfect shirt. The order came a week early but unfortunately the logo I picked was to high on the back of the shirt. I sent an email explaining the situation and they are rectifying the problem and sending me a free t-shirt. sometimes problems happen when ordering custom items.

4495,"I ordered a set of embordered polos. At first the order was delayed and I received zero communication about it, and it was difficult to get a straight answer. However when the polos did arrive, they were atrocious. You couldn't read the logo, several had loose threads, and some didn't even have a completed logo. They were unusable, and because they arrived late I couldn't rush a new order to fix them before the date I needed. I eventually go a re-order for free and those came out a lot better, still messy and not quite up to par but better and I can actually use them.

However, their customer service was far and away the best I have ever worked with. Everyone I spoke to was supper accommodating and helpful and they worked really hard to make sure my re-order was done correctly. The only reason they are getting 3 stars is because the customer service was amazing.

My order was designed and shipped promptly. The quality of shirts were exactly as described and the print was exactly as pictured in the design process and design approval stage. 2 of my shirts had minor defects mainly due to the color of the shirt itself bleeding through the design a bit, but within minutes of reaching out, and I mean minutes, they were already on top of making it right and printing me two more.

4506,"Update: upon reading my review below, a customer support rep reached out and gave me a full refund, which I do appreciate given the poor communication combined with my original order arriving on time but not being correctly printed and therefore unusable. Ultimately, my reprinted order did not arrive in time for event, as mentioned below, so the refund here was the appropriate resolution.

Rush Order Tees processed and printed an order incorrectly without letting me know there'd be a change to the design I submitted. I paid nearly double for my order for rush shipping to ensure delivery for an event I had on 11/12. The shirts arrived in time, but were not correct and therefore I could not use them. ROT's customer support apologized and said they'd reprint the order, but knowing the order would arrive after my event, I let them know this was not the desired resolution since the reprinted shirts would be of no value given their late arrival. ROT's team stopped responding to me and sent the order anyway. The reprinted order was correct, but came too late. This approach is very poor customer service, especially since it's clear the mistake was on ROT's end, since they were able to re-print the design correctly the second time around. Why couldn't they have done this the first time, or reached out to let me know if there was some issue? Why did they ignore me when I politely requested a refund since a re-print would arrive too late? I won't be using this company's service again. Their approach to customer service and error resolution leaves much to be desired.",Rush Order Tees ,R

When it did arrive a day after the event.it was on a totally different t shirt than i had originally ordered and it had a misprint on the front- a big white dot that was not connected to anything- a simple quality control before it left the facility would have caught this.

I was initially glad to have found RushOrderTees after contacting their Online Chat that confirmed delivery could be made for customized T-shirts to arrive on Oct 28th if I placed the order before 7 pm (Eastern time) on Oct 22nd.

However, at 4 pm on the same day (Oct 22nd), when finalizing the order, I was then informed that they could not abide by the agreed date and would actually need 4 extra days to deliver the T-shirts (Nov 1st).

After raising my concerns to the sales and customer services via email, all they would reply was that I could placing an order online or by calling them without addressing or even acknowledging any of the concerns. Very unhelpful and not at all useful.

The whole experience has been extremely misleading, especially having being told very different information as well as their website stating that same day turnaround would be possible and that they advertise that they could delivery in 4 business days.

4516,"Received my order on August 3, 2021, but it was not quite what I ordered..The image and lettering were in white and should have been black..I called customer support and spoke with Tyler who was very polite and efficient..He is rectifying the situation and I should receive the correct shirts..Thank you for your great customer assistance.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4517,"I have recently started a non profit organization (Pier22 Fishing)with my buddies and we needed a place to order product from. I have been working with RushOrderTees for about 3 weeks. The service they provide is unreal. They offer great products but what really makes this company amazing is the customer service they provide. They are quick to respond, help you with your design and offer solutions for you. When there is an issue with your order they are quick to fix it. I've never had customer service like this before. When they say real people unreal service it's 100% spot on.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4518,"This company has excellent customer service. I spoke to a representative (Angel) on the phone to discuss the possibility of creating 2 shirts that I could pick up the very next day, and he worked with me to get the entire thing done in an impressive timely fashion. In less than 24 hours I went from having a shirt idea to having the two shirts printed and in my hands. The shirts are good quality and as I said the customer service is really excellent - all of the 3 people I spoke to were extremely responsive and knowledgable, and went above and beyond to get my task done. Highly recommend using this company for your t-shirt orders.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4519,Great quality and great customer service! Tianna W. helped me update my order seamlessly.,Rush Order Tees ,R
4520,"Their customer service is 5 stars but as far as making the product look the way I designed it, it would equate 3 stars. I have ordered from them twice now and the first initial shipment has always had some type of issue. The first time I ordered, they gave me the wrong size and wrong brand and the print in the front was incorrectly placed. However, they are very quick to reply to my email and fix this issue by sending me a new one. The replacement hoodie was exactly correct to what I had initially designed. The second time I ordered, the only issue I had was that the print in the front was place in the center of the chest rather than the left as I had designed. Again, they were quick to reply and informed me that they would send a new one. Overall, I would give them a 4 stars. They put forth a good effort and if there is ever any issue they respond immediately and fix the problem. I would recommend this to people who have patience. They take a bit to process the order and print/make the product, it does take a bit of time. In addition, if there is an issue with the product, it will take more time for them to send out a new one to replace the faulty one. Worth a shot though!",Rush Order Tees ,R

4525,5 star service hands down!.I ordered shirts for my business and a few weeks later had letters falling off from the wash.

4526,Received the wrong product. Was a little frustrated after spending so much money only to receive the wrong shirts.

Thanks!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4529,I ordered a single custom screen printed garment from RushOrderTees; this was my first-ever experience with this company. I purchased from them because they offered a wide selection of products and the design interface was super-easy to navigate. When the order arrived--a week earlier than they had promised--the graphic had been printed in the wrong place. I emailed the company to alert them to the error and within a few hours they had not only responded to express their disappointment in and offer their apologies for the snafu but also to tell me they'd made the correction AND had already begun the process of re-printing the job . . . for FREE. How could I ever do business with anyone else? 100% satisfied!,Rush Order Tees ,R
4530,"RushOrderTees is AWESOME! I asked favors of their team twice during the process, and they beyond stepped up to the bat both times to meet my specific needs. I am filled with gratitude. To see why the shirt they made is so important to me, go to Instagram on July 29 and look at posts by @gal0tgo. I cannot rave about RushOrderTees enough -- from ease of creating my order, placing my order, fair pricing, working with members of their customer service team, turnaround time, to finished product. They earned 5++++ stars with me!

Keep up the stellar job, RushOrderTees!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4531,"This site is great!.They make sure to get your order to you on time and work with you throughout the entire process.

I was able to chat and confirm our original design would be suitable..After sign off I submitted for proofs..They were not exactly as we expected, but they were able to rectify within 24 hrs and still get us our shirts on the day we were meant to receive them..They came out perfectly and the shirt is great quality!",Rush Order Tees ,R

I contacted RushOrderTees and they immediately came to the rescue..They saved our party and made a lifelong customer..Everyone loved the shirts, and wore them to school the next day..I washed these shirts, and they still look great - highly, highly recommend!

4537,"I placed an order just to try out this company with some basic work t shirts for my Mobile Auto Repair Business. My order arrived about a week sooner then expected. The online design process was pretty simple. My only problem was when i opened my package and started looking at the shirts, I found 2 of them to have what looked like a crease from them folding them but upon trying to get it unstuck it started peeling the logo. I reached out and they handled the problem very quickly and will be sending me a new order to solve my problem. I get it this place is very busy and may have just folded the tees a little too soon as to why the silk screen stuck to itself. But the problem was addressed and overall I am happy with the quality of shirts and also the customer service. Highly recommended if your looking to have shirts made for any business or event. Thanks Rushordertees i now look official with my new company shirts.",Rush Order Tees ,R

Colors got mixed up but their customer service is second to none and re shipped replacements to make my experience the best possible. Definitely will recommend and order again. 5 star items, shipping, and customer service!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4539,"It's the poor and unprofessional customer service for me. It's Mike who could not offer any concrete information on where my order is and could only blame me for choosing free shipping for my $200.00 plus order and blame their delivery partner while not confirming the shirts have even shipped. Makes me think they're way behind on production and nothing has shipped at all. I'm not used to calling any professional business with an issue and being met with such lack of accountability AND lack of being solution oriented AND no apology. Just finger pointing and no real update on an order ppaced over three weeks ago. Being I and the company are in the same city, I would have taken an offer to pick up my order. But you can't pick up what's not produced.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4540,I had a t shirt shipped to me that had some stains from the printing on it. Within minutes of notifying them they started the process of making and sending me a new one. It arrived within days.

Thank you!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4542,"I made a custom T-shirt order in plenty of time to receive my order for a specific event..After approving my design I was given the delivery date..The date came and went but my shirts never showed up..I contacted customer support and was given an updated delivery date (a week later)..The second date also came and went but no order was delivered..I also never received any updated information..The event has now passed..I am demanding a full refund..""Rush Order Tees"" should be called ""You Might Get Your Order IF We Feel Like It."".I am extremely disappointed with this company.

UPDATE:.My initial 1 star review has been updates to 3 stars..The event I needed the shirts for has already passed..After the event passed I contacted the company to cancel my order and get a refund..The customer service people were very nice..They cancelled my order and I received a full refund..I was also contacted by the V.P. of sales (Josh Hannum) who apologized for my order not being ready in time..He fulfilled my order at no cost to me!.The shirts arrived today and are wonderful..If I could have received the shirts when I needed them I would have given 5 stars!.By sending the order, even after I cancelled it, you showed me you do care about the customers..Thank you.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4543,"UPDATE:.I must upgrade my experience from a 4 star rating to a 5 star rating due to the efforts of Michael and Alyssa with RushOrderTees!.They promptly addressed the paint residue issue I had by replacing the shirts that had the residue on them..I also mentioned to Alyssa that I actually needed to add a shirt to my order because I had miscounted the number of shirts I needed and she gave me the additional shirt free of charge!.this company is top notch!.They went above and beyond to ensure my experience was the best experience possible..They deserve 6 stars!.I highly recommend using them for your custom t-shirt needs!

Everything about my experience ordering with RushOrderTees was a 5 star experience except the skill with which the shirts were printed..At least 3 of the 13 shirts I ordered had paint residue on the back side..I had nothing printed on the back of the shirts. My order definitely qualified as a RUSH order so I am assuming that may be the reason for the sloppiness on a few of the shirts.",Rush Order Tees ,R

The colors were not vibrant and the image was faded. I was disappointed so I called the customer service number provided in the email and easily reached a real person. It was difficult to hear her, but I explained my situation, and she had pulled up my order immediately and said they would send me out a new one at no cost. The situation was handled easily.

4560,"Do NOT, I Repeat, Do Not use this company! I have used this company twice for the Merch at my Performing Arts school. The first time we spent around $250. When the merch arrived it was extremely cheap quality and the designs were wrong. However we tried this company a second time. Silly us. We spent around $1600 for hoodies and sweatpants. Not a huge order for the high price. When the merch arrived 90% of it was damaged. Not considering the extremely cheap material of both the hoodies and the pants, but the pockets to the hoodies were all hanging off, the stitching was terribly done, there were strings and tattered parts, the pressed logos were peeling, most of the hoodie pockets had small holes AND we were missing items §¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. We attempted several times to communicate with this extremely unprofessional company. Not only were we treated as if it was our fault the order had so many flaws, but they refused to take the full order back and return our money. They also refused to send us the missing merch we paid for or to replace all of the damaged merch. We sent in photos but were told that wasn't good enough to prove the damage. I lost money on this order. Not only that but I've had to return money to families that purchased merch and after ONE WASH - had to contact me because the hoodie pockets came right off the hoodies. Not only is their product cheap, overpriced and damaged but their customer service is enough to make us never return. Waste of money and time!",Rush Order Tees ,R

I will have new shirts within the week on the house. Will definitely be using them again if I need more shirts.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4571,"I put an order in 8 days before I needed it (yes - poor planning on my part but thats why I went with ""RUSH ORDER TEES."" The soonest I could get it was 7 days later - 1 day before the event I was hosting. 2 days before the shirts were to arrive, I got an update from the delivery system saying I wouldn't have my shirts until 2 days later than I paid for (which was after the event). I called and the woman on the phone told me it was UPS' fault and not theirs, but that they would remedy the situation by doing the order - that day in their shop - and overnight it to me to get it to me by 12pm Saturday. I was thrilled with the customer service.

BUT - Saturday at 12 came and went - and I was literally waiting at my house just for the shirts to arrive before I left for my event. No shirts came. I called and asked where they were and customer service told me ""Oh yeh, it looks like we weren't actually able to get them printed in time. Sorry."" That's it. They refunded me, which is fine, but I would have paid DOUBLE to have them in the time frame they were guaranteed. And once this rush order wasn't going to be possible, had the company let me know then I could have made alternative plans.

Long story short - if you need a rush order and are hoping using ""RushOrderTees will be your saving grace, look elsewhere.",Rush Order Tees ,R

4585,"PROS: The.website is sharp; the custom t-shirt designer is functional; the ordering process was relatively painless.

Cons: The printing was sub-par; the base and the ink were too thin and the result was the logos look worn out and faded which was not the intent or the design.

Worse, the logo designs use a considerable amount of navy blue and they are on a medium to dark grey shirt. With the poor printing, the logos are barely visible.

The printers completely disregarded my custom layout and just printed the logos directly in the center of the shirt at the wrong scale. There was no attempt at all to position the logos as laid out in the custom design or to scale them as laid out.

To the best of my knowledge, I never received any kind of review notification. I received email notification of my order and shipping confirmation. In the shipping confirmation, that was the first time I could review the t-shirts. On the order, there was a note saying that they followed the custom design. So I assumed they actually did. However, when I got the t-shirts, it was clear they did not.

SUMMARY: Currently very disappointed with what was delivered. I emailed them and let them know how disappointed I was. I haven't received a reply yet.

Overall, the t-shirts are honestly unusable for the purpose I ordered them for. The design is barely legible.

UPDATE 28 AUG 2020: A special thank you to Alyssa for getting back to me and trying to work out the situation!

First, a correction on the custom layout issue; when I was reviewing my custom layout after emailing RushOrderTees about the issues with the shirts, I realized there was white text on the layout image that clearly said that the design was outside the print boundaries they could print.

I didn't notice it when making my order. So that was clearly my user error.

While the layout issue was originally my fault, I do think that either the website's custom designer or the printers themselves should have caught that the layout was outside of the print boundary and verified the print before proceeding.

If either had occurred, I wouldn't have ordered the t-shirts when I realized I couldn't print them using the layout I wanted.

On the printing itself, that remained a quality control issue. The ink was simply too faded. I'm not sure if it was a base issue or that my print would have required more applications. Regardless, despite the layout issue, I wouldn't have been happy with the shirts provided.

Customer service (Alyssa) were really great; she went above and beyond to try to correct the situation and I really appreciate that. They offered a reprint, but due to the layout restrictions I can't take them up on that offer.

In the end, while I was disappointed with the product, RushOrderTees did do their absolute best to try to correct the issue and that goes a long way in my book.

If my print was more conventional and the layout wasn't an issue, I am certain that even if there were print errors, RushOrderTees would have stepped up and corrected them in a timely manner.

I have changed my rating to reflect the level of customer service I received in this situation.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4586,I chose RushOrder because they had a great selection of stylish shirts and colors. Unfortunately the printing process is unreliable.

I messaged them about it and within 10 minutes it was already added. Also, when I received the package, the hoodies were designed really well and with incredible quality, however, I received the wrong material hoodie. I just thought, ""Oh well, guess I'll just stick with these ones,"" but they replaced them the moment they found out about the mistake with no extra charge! Overall, the customer service is 10/10 and I would gladly order from them again.",Rush Order Tees ,R

4595,"STARTED AS A 1 STAR REVIEW BUT CHANGED TO A 5 STAR

Initially, I called to Rush Order Tees to discuss my order and ""Steve"" was about as rude, short, curt and coy as a pathetic customer service rep can be.

I had issues with the order and the graphics but ""Steve"", the customer service rep, was not helpful at all and totally dismissive.

UPDATE: AFTER I RECEIVED A PERSONAL CALL FROM ALYSSA THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE MANAGER LESS THAN 24 HOURS LATER TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE WITH AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE, I CHANGED MY REVIEW TO A 5 STAR.

I was offered a full refund and replacement so I can see ""what their quality really is"" well, if the replacement was supposed to show anything better, IT DIDN'T! PLEASE do your research better. I used them based on reviews. but it seems they ask for 5 star reviews after they refund you and replace. expecting everyone to just be satisfied bc they got their money back in turn for a 5 star review. but I'm speaking the truth and will not give a good review just because I was asked to. The only reason I gave a second star is because their customer service IS very nice and willing to satisfy their customers, but this customer isn't satisfied and the quality I received is quite embarrassing.",Rush Order Tees ,R

Father's Day is tomorrow, so I have to go buy another gift, when this company suppose to have my shirt delivered before tomorrow! There is never any up to date tracking and when you email them, they just apologize for the delay! If you need anything in a timely manner, please order elsewhere!

4678,"Had a bad experience with a customer service rep. Within 40 minutes of posting about my experience I got a call from the VP of Sales Josh. He was super understanding of my situation, took full responsibility for the sales rep and apologized, and then did everything he could to make it right. I really appreciate Josh reaching out and then bringing in a few other higher ups to resolve the issue. Left at 4 stars cause I haven't got the t-shirts yet, but will update the review once they're delivered.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4679,"I had to place a t-shirt order with only a couple of weeks' turnaround from when I received the artwork. The Rush Order Tees website is super easy to use (I had never ordered shirts before), prices were great, men's and ladies' sizes were a big plus, and the staff are very prompt and responsive from the time you click Submit. Totally painless experience, and the shirts came out great!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4680,"Their website claims, ""Our goal isn't just customer satisfaction, it's customer joy!"".I believe that..My rush order was on time, done right and high quality..Their design tools were super easy to use..They kept me informed every step of the way and even helped me make a change to my order when I realized it wasn't exactly right (my fault, not theirs.).A great experience..I would definitely recommend them and use them again.",Rush Order Tees ,R

4683,"We needed shirts with an incredibly short turn around time and all local businesses and our normal vendors were unable to fulfill the request..I found Rush Order Tees through a Google search and they were the only company that even agreed to our project based on the due date.

It was a tall order due to the nature of our request and constant changes, but Francis was incredible to work with and handled each change and request very professionally..The shirts arrived right on time and the quality was impressive..Thick shirts and the printing is nice - not the type to peel right off.

Thank you Rush Order Tees!.You made it look easy when I know it wasn't!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4684,"Wow wow wow.these guys rock! Gigi, Bria, thanks!

I ordered a single hoodie with printed vinyl to use for advertising during an upcoming trip. The first sweatshirt that arrived was disappointing. The hoodie itself seemed to be of great quality, but the black ink faded quite a bit from the first gentle wash..And the large fit more like an XL+.

I contacted them and, without hesitation, they reordered a medium and ask the production team to ensure the print was fully cured to (hopefully) not fade as the previous one did..They are even rushing the shipping so it'll arrive in time for my trip. That, folks, is the sign of an outstanding business.

If this replacement is what I hope and if it arrives before I leave as promised, I'm going to be one extremely satisfied customer..Already, they've impressed me with the way they have run everything up to this point..Mistakes happen. It's how those errors are addressed that separates the professionals from the amateurs..These guys are pros.",Rush Order Tees ,R

I called Rush Order Tees, they we're super friendly and assured me that the shirts would be done and shipped across the US in time for everyone to have their custom t-shirts at the party..Their team designed what I asked them to design, for free, and the shirts came out awesome..The price was amazingly competitive and the shipping was FREE..I loved ordering from this company and will do it again next time I need shirts or hoodies or something - looks like they have a good selection of products..I'd recommend them to everyone!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4695,"When reading about this company on their website, I thought it was perfect.
After beginning, I found that instead of designers, they were people who could pull clip art and letter together quickly..I read the whole website and never found what the charge would be for help..It was very expensive..When I finished, I asked the person working with me if I would get the discount at the top of the site..He assured me I would..So I accepted the mediocre shirts and went to checkout..At checkout there was no discount so I got back on chat..At this time the rep told me it was included no additional..There sure needs to be improvement on the website and in the communication..If I ever use them again which is doubtful, I will sure do my own clip art and letters..They did ship promptly and they came as promised.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4696,"Horrible experience dealing with RushOrderTees.com. While the customer service reps were nice, they still sent me incorrectly printed t-shirts for 3 orders in a row.

I loved the way the print came up and even with Covid-19 going on they kept me up to date on my order. I will be ordering again, (side note: recommend going up a size or 2 for a little more space, especially if your on the bigger size. Certain shirt and clothing brands provided will fit tight or a little snug if your not famliar with that brand like Gildan, or Triple A) Overall great experience!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4701,"I came up with the idea for the class t-shirt literally 24 hours before it was needed. From the first online chat for ordering to the onetime delivery, the service was outstanding.

Now I need to find a place local, go out of my way and spend more money to get it done before this coming Monday. Very upset with the results and hope they make it right asap.

The Rush Order Tees Crew was excellent in both service and quality of product.

4713,"I ordered a t shirt with a special logo for my son for Easter. I was told multiple times through email that it was guaranteed arrival by April 10th. well April 10th came and went and I didn't receive anything. I called and the customer service rep was rude and said they couldn't guarantee delivery because ups is prioritizing shipments. I can understand that but don't guarantee a date if you aren't able to fulfill it by that date. I paid and extra 17.99 for shipping to get here in time. Their website status said it was still being processed and the rep said it was shipped, so which one was it? I wouldn't have purchased the shirt for a total of $40.00 if I knew it wouldn't be here in time for the event it was purchased for. I asked for a refund (since I don't have the shirt and it wasent sent yet) and I was told that they would only refund shipping.very disappointed and will not shop with them again.",Rush Order Tees ,R

4715,"I have nothing but good things to say about this company.

Fast, accommodating, very knowledgeable staff, and importantly, Matt made certain that I was ordering exactly what I wanted. We needed a few shirts in time for a short notice interview with the local news station for our business and turned to Rush Order Tees since there wasn't a --single-- local embroider who could take our work in less than a week's time.

I'd highly recommend Rush Order Tees to anyone and we'll certainly be back to order more shirts for our company.",Rush Order Tees ,R

4717,I was shocked at how fast they confirmed my order on such short notice.

Their tshirt quality is great and the design transferred perfectly!,Rush Order Tees ,R

4723,"Easy to order, accurate, prompt delivery and fair-priced. The ONLY reason we are not giving 5 stars is although the product (aprons) was very nice looking, the fabric was quite thin, not as heavy as we were anticipating. We would likely use them for future purchases when we have more time and to perhaps ask for a sample of fabric.",Rush Order Tees ,R

4726,"Their website was easy to use and very clear. Awesome customer service, responded quickly and worked with me on making a final proof. They even made a new font to work with my design.

I was able to call them and Josh helped with sizing and fitting compared to items i already owned, he spent his time making sure my order was correct and sizing was perfect.
The items came in yesterday and when i opened the box I saw my new company shirts, front was VERY CLEAR and great printing, the back of the items even better, thick ink and ready for a long term usage..The t-shirt alone was a very high commercial grade material.

They will get my business in the future for many years to come.",Rush Order Tees ,R

I will definitely be using this company again and will recommend them to others!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4732,"I did not have a good experience with Rush Order Tees. Although the shirts looked great, I was not given the correct quantity of each size.

4736,I've tried quite a few ‚Äúdesign your own‚Äù sites but I always come back to Rush Order Tees. They make it so easy and the quality can't be beat. Just ordered two more shirts so I think that makes about 12 altogether. I'm addicted! You won't be disappointed.,Rush Order Tees ,R
4737,"Please don't order from here. The shirts had proofs that were all messed up. It took so many emails to try and get it corrected and I eventually gave up. Then I got an email saying the shirts were delivered when they hadn't been and we've never had a missing package. I call, they did a reprint but I had to send someone to drive to their building to collect because I leave for my honeymoon tomorrow. They had to change it to low quality printing to get it done and I no longer would get the tanks I ordered. I send the person, he gets there and the building is empty three hours before the closing time I was told. He shouted hello a bunch of times and even looked around for someone. This took about twenty mins. Finally someone comes out and tells him he is not allowed to be in the building that we were instructed to go to. My pickup person tells them why he's there and the employee said they would go check. He comes out and says another 20 mins. After this poor person literally circled the building. During all this I was on hold until the call prompted an automatic callback which never came. I'll advise anyone, stay away.",Rush Order Tees ,R

I will be using them again in the future without question.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4740,My students came across Rush Order Tees over the summer while they were designing their senior shirts this year..The website is easy to use and the personal service is great as well..One of the greatest benefits is the price..I loved that there wasn't any hidden fees and to top it off the prices were the lowest we found..I've already recommended Rush Order Tees to other clubs and organizations at my school and I'm getting ready to place another order for myself as well.,Rush Order Tees ,R

4743,"Fantastic customer service and quality! I ordered 10 shirts for a family event last Monday, received by Friday. Unfortunately the womens t shirts ran small so needed to order 2 more shirts. No problem, one phone call on Sunday morning, and the new shirts will arrive by Wednesday. That is amazing! It's the week before Christmas too. The shirt quality is excellent, womens bella is super soft cotton, but slim fit and runs small. Anvil more true to size fit apparently. Men's premium ts are excellent quality, soft and a good weight. Print quality also excellent. I highly recommend and will definitely order again. Thank you for the great service!

I spent hours trying to make t shirts at those other sites where you can sell your cool design, but Rushordertees is by far the easiest to navigate, create and order. And get actual rush shipping.

4744,"Easy to design, very polite customer service and a.quick turnaround, They were very helpful in honoring a coupon voucher that I had misplaced and that had expired by one day when I found it!

You guys are amazing.
THANK YOU",Rush Order Tees ,R
4748,"I had them change my design multiple times, sometimes repetitively back to an older version just to make sure that the final was truly what I wanted. They were quick to answer questions (they were very kind and polite with me) and change my design if needed. My purchase was also shipped and delivered by the time that had been stated. The designs were also very good quality! If someone was looking to purchase I would DEFINITELY recommend them!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4749,"Not reliable,
Placed an order for a specific date of delivery. Had to confirm with staff via phone service that hung up on you after holding for a long time. Left number and never got a call back, so called the next day, they still confirmed the shipment receipt date. Order was shipped on the date it was due and delivery would not be on time. A total waste of time and an event ruined!",Rush Order Tees ,R

This is the first time we've had our shirts shipped well before camp. We've used various local companies over the last 15 years, but so far, Rush Order Tees is the best. Great price and quality. I would caution for group orders, be sure to order enough, because it is a little costly to go back and order a few later.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4751,"Great job by the folks at Rush Order Tees. I judge a lot of businesses based on what happens if something doesn't go according to plan. We ordered 100 shirts that came with a misprint.

4759,I ordered a hoodie from RushOrderTees and when it arrived my whole hoodie was completely changed. I ordered red ink and it came basically faded on the hoodie. Not to mention they gave me a completely different hoodie than I asked for. I called multiple times because my order came about 2 weeks late but I didn't mind because of the outbreak but I had hoped that when it finally came that it would be worth it but that wasn't the case. They had apparently ran out of stock for the hoodie I had ordered so they replaced it with a more thinner cheaper quality hoodie without informing me. If it was possible to give a zero rating I would. This hoodie was $50 and looked more like it cost $5 the most.,Rush Order Tees ,R
4760,"If there were an option for a sixth star on this rating, I would give it! Rush Order Tees was incredible to work with. I experienced nothing but friendly, timely, quality, customer-centric service that stood out to me above other vendors. My experience proved to me that Rush Order Tees is definitely on top of their game. I highly recommend them!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4761,They were easy to work with as my order changed..When there was a very minor issue with the order they MORE than made up for it with sending replacements.PLUS!.No questions asked..Great customer service,Rush Order Tees ,R
4762,"RushOrderTees was overall wonderful. Great service, very specific as to what their rules and regulations are for a custom designed t shirt . I ordered 20 custom shirts with designs on the front and back for my college's theater club, and they turned out great!
Just for reference, my colors for the design were black, white and red on a black t shirt, so it was a pretty simple design in the scheme of things. I like that you can adjust things to your liking, and RushOrderTees does a wonderful job at keeping a customer in the loop. They also have great suggestions as to the placement of designs on shirts.
The only con is the following: some of the shirts had cardboard fibers on theme because there was no barrier inside between the shirts and the box for shipping. I wish they wrapped the shirts in plastic, and THEN put them in the box.
Even still, all the sizes were correct, the design came out exactly as I wanted, the prices are fair, and everyone loved the result! Will definitely be using this service again! :)",Rush Order Tees ,R
4763,"The tee shirts came out perfect an online ordering is super easy. The sales associates seem unnecessary unless you need help designing your shirt. They did not offer any additional price cuts, even though they said they were checking for the ""best price"" a couple of times. It was the same price the website quoted. I found an online coupon code and got a better deal on my own. The associate seemed upset when I told her I already ordered; I assume because she did not get the commission or whatever. Overall, a good experience and an awesome product we are super happy with, I would just skip the sales people.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4764,"Very pleased with our experience. We needed shirts fast and I found this company.on the internet. Took a chance.they took our order easily and quickly over the phone and the internet - simultaneously. They made our graphic look great and I appreciated the women's shirt style which actually looks good on the women. My only complaint was that I had wanted the shirts before my meeting and they arrived the day they were supposed to, but in the evening - after I had already left for my meeting. Well I guess that was the shipper's fault.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4765,"The site was very user friendly, and the chat feature really helped me select the right product for my needs and budget..The proofs were provided quickly, as well as when I requested changes. Once the product arrived, I was very happy with the quality and would definitely use them again, and recommend to others.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4766,"On the night i placed my order, i realized that i made some mistakes on the names..I emailed them and the next business day they called me back..They were very cooperative, helpful and understanding..They corrected my mistake and the t-shirts were delivered on time..Having not ordered from them before, i did not know what quality the printing would be..I was delighted to see it was very high quality..I will definitely order from them again..Top-notch company, top notch product.",Rush Order Tees ,R

4773,"The total experience was wonderful. The t-shirts turned out fantastic and everyone loved them! This is rated 5 stars BUT
It did get a bit bothersome when ""sales"" would call me and text me pushing me to order. I was working with one person and was very happy with her. I finally got fed up with the sales pitches that I just placed the order and was very satisfied.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4774,Great customer service! Thank you team for the quick response and thank you Dana for helping me out on the phone. Super nice people all around as far as I can tell.

So I chatted with Francis from RushOrderTees on a Thursday who assured me 500 hats could arrive that Monday.

4781,They were really helpful in getting back on my order and said they would send a replacement right away because there was something misspelled.

4782,"I needed 22 teeshirts for a family cruise that my family and I were taking on June 25th. I contacted RushOrder Tees on 6/10 and needed the shirts by 6/21.I had the distinct honor and pleasure of talking with Bria Brown, who not only got me a very good deal on the shirts , but also gave me expedited shipping at no additional cost. I had to contact her several times for changes in the order, and she was always so very pleasant and helpful each time. She made the process so much more pleasant. When I received the shirts, I was blown away by how great they looked. My family members absolutely loved them. Miss Bria Brown also contacted me a few days after I received the shirts to ask if everything was alright. I was so pleasantly surprised by her going the extra mile to contact me. Rush Order Tees should be very proud to have people like Bria Brown represent their company. Talking about customer service, this pleasant young lady was exceptional. I will always use this company for now on and have told friends and family how great this company is to do business with. Thank you Bria Brown for your time, your patience, and for making me feel that I was your only customer and my satisfaction was top priority, I will always remember my experience with YOU!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4783,Excellent experience. There was a miscommunication between sales and the art department but Karie from the art department spoke to me on the phone and cleared everything up. I got my shirts the day they were promised and they were great! My client was thrilled with the end product and we will be ordering hoodies and other items in the fall. This will be my go to company now for this type of project.,Rush Order Tees ,R

4786,"They have the best online custom t-shirt maker by far so i spent hours creating multiple t-shirts knowing they both accepted PayPal and Visa as payments and they also send overseas. But when i asked for a shipping quote everything became dry. No shipping quote and no other payments than by wire accepted for ""security"" reasons. i have never in my internet ordering history been asked to do so. not even with motor parts well over many grands in value have i been asked to pay by wire.",Rush Order Tees ,R

very easy and quick..The service is unbelievable can't say enough good
things about this company.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4788,Nice enough people to deal with as far as placing the order goes. The printed shirts were fine but sizing the designs for the shirt was a bit tricky. The scale of the shirt image they use for proofs is undersized so your printed design on the final product looks smaller than you intend. They have not taken any responsibility for this discrepancy and have not communicated any interest in changing that. Buyer beware.,Rush Order Tees ,R
4789,"In full disclosure, we were not the greatest of clients. We had last minute changes, and funding problems on our end, however, despite this the folks at Rush Order were very understanding, and worked with us every step of the way. We will continue using them, the shirts were a very high quality, very durable and the printing was superb, at the right price.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4790,"Their guarantee is worthless.
I wanted a custom shirt for a specific occasion on a specific date..The shirt was terribly expensive because I wanted only one shirt, $32.32 for one shirt with a photo and one word under the photo..I needed it by Friday, on the shipping options there was an option ""Guarantee delivery by Friday"" for $21.99 extra..Now I'm at $54.31 for one shirt delivered by Friday..Friday rolls around, late in the day and I start to worry so I log in to track the package and their website actually says that the order is on time for guaranteed delivery on Monday..What kind of nonsense is that? I have the email to prove the Friday guarantee - and they certainly took my money..I call the tollfree number, nobody answers..I called 5 more times over the next hour, nobody there but they wanted me to leave a voicemail..Rush Order Tees has poor practices and non-existent customer service..How can you call yourselves ""rush order"" anything if you mess up this badly on a rush order?",Rush Order Tees ,R

The image printed on the hoodie was not like the proof sent to me; it is small and looks very faded, not vibrant at all.

However after speaking to Alyssa in the customer service department, the company has vindicated themselves. She contacted us & listen to all of our concerns with the order. Shortly after she had a new order sent to our office. Mrs. Seiders is truly an asset to the company.",Rush Order Tees ,R

4804,"It was easy to do the artwork online. Thankfully they sent me a proof before printing. 1)They did not read my comments so the artwork was wrong. I needed them to replace text inside a logo and they didn't do it the first time.2) I was sent a message that a representative would be calling me first thing in the morning because I wanted to change the number of larges and add a few smalls. Well, he never called so I finally went on the chat line. 3) I was told my order was ok'd and I would have to pay a $30 restocking fee to change my quantity.

4808,Maybe this service is best for logos. I got a picture on my shirt and it was not the best quality. It looked like I washed my shirt 44 times and the colors faded off. It took over a month to a shirt that was not to my liking and I could not wear it on the special day. It came a week after. I don't think I'll be ordering anything else from Rush.,Rush Order Tees ,R

4846,I was so good until this new Manager came in Mr. Taylor he treated me like I was in the military or some sort. He threw clothes in my face instead of talking to me. I took that all for 2 weeks and the 2nd week of the last day I just couldn't take anymore so I cried my heart out. I am a Temp I am not full time and also I don't like to be treated as if I'm a peasant. Even some of the printers at belt 2 have an issue with him as well. I get along with everyone. I never had 1 issue until he arrived! Also I would like to add that I think that the owner is an awesome guy and he definitely doesn't deserve the treatment that is given from what I see he's accommodating everyone to make production better new equipment= more production more production= more money more money= you all eventually get to have a rate your comfortable withíØ I've never seen such ungratefulness to this degree in my lifeò©,Rush Order Tees ,R
4847,The T shirts we ordered came out looking exactly as our prints! I thought it would be difficult because we had a variety of different small prints and colors but it looked great! We will definitely recommend this company to others and use them again in the future! The only thing to note is most sizes are a little large if you cannot chose between mens and womens sizing except the XXL was a little small for most people that normally wear a XXL. Overall we loved our softball tees and the customer service was phenomenal!,Rush Order Tees ,R
4848,"Very terrible experience. My shirts were only printed with the front design even after I received an e-mail confirming that the front and back of the shirt would have a design. The associate tried to convince me that the back of the shirt wasn't selected to be printed, which didn't make sense especially considering the e-mail confirmation. The attempt made by the associate to fix the problem was not feasible due to my time frame..The company definitely doesn't live up to it's name. And they were very presumptuous to offer me a discount when I order from them again. I will not order from them anymore.",Rush Order Tees ,R
4849,"Love the ease of the website, great tools..Super easy to use..Was bummed about the sizing however..They don't run slightly smaller, they are MUCH smaller than usual sizes..I love the quality of the shirts and the printing, but now have three shirts that I cannot use for any of the people that I bought them for..I never mind paying for something quality, which these are, but am bummed that I have paid nearly $100 for unusable items..Please make up an accurate sizing chart, with lengths, widths, etc!",Rush Order Tees ,R
4850,"They are Terrible
They order the shirts you want to print on before even letting you know if they can or cannot do what you are asking.
Had to recreate my design 3 or 4 times because they cant do simple stuff.Like they say.
Finally give them one to do, they try to turn it into a extra order on top of the ones they couldn't do. This was Michael.
Then they do the order wrong and won't give a refund.
Then try to charge ME to fix their wrong doing
Wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy
Now I have 96 shirts that I might not be able to sell, which was 1600
Yep, it was a big order
Save yourself, go to a professional",Rush Order Tees ,R
4851,Top notch group. Most places just print your picture on a shirt which looks amateurish. Here they incorporate or blend your picture or design within the fabric adjusting background to give the appearance that design is part of the fabric. The end result is product that looks professional but unique. Finally they have a large assortment of colors and fabric designs. Highly recommended!,Rush Order Tees ,R

After not receiving the proof for 1 1/2 weeks I started sending emails and calling, and was told every time I should receive proof the next day, which never happened. so I had to call again and again. Finally I received the proof 2 days before the promised delivery date. The shirts were delivered on time, but with the wrong print color and many print smudges on the shirts which made them look pretty bad.

4898,"I am the Creative Manger for a finance company., I have been designing and working with numerous vendors for a long time. I came across this site by searching for custom rushed shirts at a reasonable price. At first, the CSR, lets call him ""FRED"" was fabulous, prompt and polite. After putting the order in with specific instructions and mock-ups, I awaited for the proofs to come my way for approval. A few days pasted with no activity, so I reached out FRED for status on my order with no response via email or by phone three times. I was able to speak to other CSR's who said they would get the message to FRED. A couple days past when he finally reached out to me via email stating, that in order for my order to be processed, I would have to pay an additional cost ($70) due to the fact that I added more design then quoted first time around. But that was not the case, I sent him specific instructions and mock ups so there was no misunderstandings. He stated that I told him that I did not want a certain design when in fact I never did. Without going down a rabbit hole, I chalked it up as a mis-comminication and said lets meet in the middle, FRED said no. That he had me recorded saying what he was referring to, and was not very nice and fabulous as he first was. So with that said, i told him that I am canceling the order, I requested a credit on my card with a reference number, to speak with a manger, and a copy of the voice reordering of my conversations. He then agreed to wave the fee and continue with the order.

I called today, I was on the phone with Francis and as he was rushing me off the phone ( You can tell he didnt want to be on the phone with me, apparently I was assigned to him) when he said he was going to send some pics of my request. I thought it was coming and I was sitting there at my computer, 2 hours later I called. I need this asap and 3 hours later.no one answering. Still waiting for the pics. When I called the third time.

Quality- mostly I would say the quality was great & The print was perfect except the runoff of extra threads in the middle of the vneck t-shirt. They were meant to give away and one of my clients asked if they could get one with out this issue. they all had the same issue.

Return- asked if I could exchange the shirts for ones that didn't have this issue. They said they couldn't but would reimburse me for the delivery - I was very disappointed in that. But that will cover the tailor costs for repair.

Disappointed but I found my solution I don't think I could order bulk",Rush Order Tees ,R

I could only find 2 XL and 1 large black ladies tshirts. But wide selection for unisex shirts. Also different options for sweaters here as well. Their printing services seem fairly reasonable priced, especially if you order over 12 shirts I believe the price is better then.",Tees N More,S
5488,"I'm a coordinator for a company located across Canada. With last minute touches to add to the event, one of them that was time sensitive. I had to order T-Shirts for the attendants.

I spoke with an associate at Tees N' More and they were more than willing to help with my order. They assured me they would be able to help me any way they could, even with a tight print schedule. I have never been so amazed, their courteous attitude, fantastic customer service, and superb quality shirts made such an impact. The T-Shirts purchased, were given such great feedback at the event, I couldn't have been more pleased to know that the quality exceeded my expectations.

I assure you, in this industry, it's comforting to know that they were exactly what I was looking for. I highly recommend you work with this company for any printing needs, and I plan on working with them in the near future. Thank you Tees N' More for excellent quality and service!",Tees N More,S
5489,"I recently purchased 100 t shirts from this company for my business. From start to finish this company was amazing.

5491,"I have had too many bad experiences with horrible customer service with this t-shirt company. Certain things you would expect a professional to know and show in their work are foreign concepts for them.

This tshirt company knows nothing about customer service and dealing with a customer. And even at the least using common sense is not something common with this company. I only came here because it's hard to find a tshirt company in Hamilton. I dealt with madjit not sure what her position is in the company, but her body language is like you are bothering her, her tone, her facial expressions to question. The last order I did I sent a design and a mock up and they printed the design with the traced line on it. When they sent it to me for approval because it was transparent I could see the trace line but you would think out of experience for printing shirts they wouldn't print a design on a shirt with dashes around the font but of course they did and when I called about it I got an angry woman yelling back at me. smh",Tees N More,S

5493,"Just dropped off a very last minute order as the previous printing company was not making any progress and I was running out of time. I came in frassled near closing and the lady at the counter did a full mock up for me, worked with my logos, checked all the sizes. I'm surprised to see these comments about bad customer service. The first thing I did when I left was call my wife and rave about how they took care of me and how relieved I was. The price for printing was significantly less than where I was at first.",Tees N More,S
5494,"Horrible experience with this company and HORRIBLE customer service. Ordered shirts for a school club and the process was difficult and long. I had outlined every detail to the person taking my order and she had difficulty understanding my order. When I picked up and reviewed my order at home, I realized I didn't receive anything in the correct sizing and color. When I called to discuss my order and why this happened, I didn't receive a single apology and got a very brief answer and was told they will be re-done. This was a huge inconvenience for me as I live very far away from the location and had to go back to get the order AGAIN. They were very inconsiderate and clearly didn't care about my service. I will NOT be using this company again, and for any student clubs at McMaster considering TeesNmore, DON'T use them.",Tees N More,S
5495,"So I had called ahead asking about the price there was miss communication and I had heard 25$ for 2 t-shirts the most basic they had and I just wanted some basic text the shirts would have been 10$ each at retail price approximately. So I get there and the total came to 56.50 for 2 basic t shirts. The quality was fine. I did not pay attention to the price cause I was in a rush. So I come back 10 minutes later and explain to her that I miss heard and was in a rush and did not pay attention to the price, she did inform me that they do not do refunds for custom tees then I said well I'm not taking these if they are 56$. So she gave me the refund with some serious attitude even though I had apologized multiple times and tried to be nice about. She told me that I wasted her time even though mine was just as wasted ( and she wasn't doing much to begin with). And the while refunding boldly said ""I can't believe this"" in front of me i did not speak out or act rude and even apologized once more. I was very displeased with the customer satisfaction and the way she spoke to me i work with customer service and I am a manager at my store I have never nor would ever talk or treat a customer the way she spoke to me.",Tees N More,S
5496,"Not impressed with the level of customer service at all. Woman was rude and seemed annoyed at questions being asked. Wanted to verify style of print to make sure a previous experience with another company did not repeat itself, and could not be given a straight answer. I only wanted to make sure the print quality and options were what I was looking for, being representation of my business and staff. I own a service and retail company and would never speak with a potential customer this way.",Tees N More,S

The gentlemen I dealt with was OM Dass, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, brushing off his rudeness both over the phone and in person etc. He was not helpful whatsoever and makes you feel as if you are an idiot for not understanding the ""print language."" Over the phone I had tried to discuss the details of the shirts which he did not read any of the information I had sent over and he was rude, talking over me and ended up hanging up on me when I told him he had bad customer service! I have never been one to write a bad review, it takes a lot for me to do so but I have never experienced anything like this!",Tees N More,S

I phoned back a week later ready to process our order - didn't happen. He had written no relative info down, despite being handed a typed useless quote. Long story short - what I think is the business owner ended up hanging up on me and telling me to go somewhere else!

Horrible HORRIBLE Business. I support local businesses all the way but do not go to this one!",Tees N More,S

Not only it inspired lot of cancer patients but the quality of these shirts stayed the same. the printing never faded off and the colors stayed the same which is so rare nowadays when you buy any shirts out!

Update: July 14. After writing the initial review I was contacted that night to address the status of my order. I had wonderful communication for about a week with David and received the products the day after they were sent..The printing was well done, the designs turned out just how I wanted them. There were several designs that I was missing sizes in, or received two of another size instead. Some had marks, which i understand will come out once washed but explaining that to customers or having to wash items before selling them is a bit inconvenient.

5561,Had a great experience ordering with ThatShirt. They made sure my design turned out perfectly on the pieces of clothing I needed for myself and my team. They met the timeline we needed and everything even arrived ahead of when we expected it considering the current Covid delays. If you need a design printed I'd highly recommend this company.,ThatShirt,T
5562,"Do not buy from this brand. I think they are out of business maybe? That or it's a scam. They do not answer phone or email - I have tried multiple times. Have been waiting over two months for my order (over a month since the estimated delivery). I can't even get a hold of them to cancel the order and get a refund.

Edit: a few days after I posted this review I was refunded for my purchase (although still not contacted about it). I am not sure if it was because of this review or not because I was not contacted. I would still not recommend this store.",ThatShirt,T

5564,"This place is great! Amazing quality, easy to use website, great price and ships super fast. My only problem with this place is that the colours of the garments online are completely different from what they are in real life. They have a disclaimer saying that it may appear different but every single time I've ordered, the colours came out completely different from what I expected, for example I ordered a ‚Äúkiwi‚Äù coloured shirt that was displayed as a soft green and the color that arrived was a safety yellow. Other than that, thatshirt is fantastic.",ThatShirt,T

5569,"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. They have the worst service, to be honest I do not even think they are a legitimate company. They will let you order take your money, but never respond back or answer phone calls there is no information on there end. I have ordered in April and I was suppose to get it in May, it is still not in and they refuse to be in contact with their customers.",ThatShirt,T

We had some t-shirts done up for a bachelor party, and I couldn't be happier with the end result..The process of submitting art online was very user friendly, and the turn-around time was super quick‚Äînot to mention the quality of the shirts themselves far exceeded anything I could have hoped for from a printshop (and the fact that they are guaranteed from cracking, peeling and fading inspires great confidence in their product)..The groom was thrilled, and so were we; I'd recommend Toronto Tees to anyone, and have no doubt I'll be back the next time I need something printed!

Cheers!",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U
5590,"Hey guys @TorontoTees !

Thank you for an amazing final product which was delivered in its appropriate timeline. The quality of graphics and garment fitment are simply perfect, this has motivated me to continue my future projects with them.

The online designer is very easy to use and doesn't feel complicated.

5591,I live in Alberta and I needed 14 Custom T-shirts for a wedding I was attending in Toronto. Downside was it was very short notice but I was so lucky to find Toronto Tees who made the entire process so easy & affordable! I was in contact with Joe who was very friendly and helped us get a great deal & of course T shirts were all ready on time!,Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U
5592,"The guys at Toronto Tees are all fantastic. I had a pretty crazy rush request and not only did they pull through and get the shirts to me 2 days before I asked, they were always open to chat about it and responded extremely quickly whenever I reached out.

Kyle and the team, thank you for everything. Great quality shirts. Amazing print quality. Great prices. The best service. If I could, I'd rate over 5/5.",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U
5593,"While the finished shirts (5 of the same 1-colour logo) met my needs and look really great, the process to get them made was less than smooth. I ordered 8 calendar days before I needed them but on the day they were meant to be ready (based on their order confirmation), there was no word from the shop. I emailed and called at the end of that day but the shirts hadn't yet been made.but the lovely guy I spoke to said he'd make sure they'd be prioritized for the next morning. The next day midday I followed up again as there still hadn't been an answer to my email from the day before. I eventually got a text that they'd be done by 2pm that day. Again, the shirts are great. We love them. Important that the quality is there of course - but if I can go in and essentially get shirts on demand I think orders that are planned and paid for over a week in advance should be managed and completed more efficiently. It seems they weren't even started until the follow-ups were done.",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U
5594,"I placed an order and the process was simple.

After receiving business cards and the colours not quite matching my request, I emailed Toronto Tee's and they assured my design and responded very quickly.

They kept me informed and the actual delivery date was much faster than the ETA.

When my shirts came, there was 1 unit that was the wrong size but they didn't give me any difficulty. They remade the correct size and even shipping to me as I don't live downtown.

Great customized service, fantastic turnaround time and I'll definitely order where soon.",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U

Other companies wanted a minimum order but I had no problems ordering just 2 shirts and pricing was good.",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U
5597,Toronto Tees is amazing. The shirt material is premium and the printing is very high quality. Needed a rushed order for a birthday present and they accommodated it with no issues.,Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U
5598,"Great quality! I ordered a small batch of hoodies and was really impressed with their quality, I wasn't expecting much for the price. I also got a call to confirm my text because it was missing an apostrophe, which was part of the design but it goes to show the effort and attention to detail they provide. Excellent! Design to doorstep was a week, and their site estimated delivery date much longer. I'll be using these guys in the future.",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U
5599,Amazing experience. Tom was very friendly and helpful. I gave him the design and t-shirt was ready in less then 5 min! Great quality for a fair price. I'll definitely use their services again. Highly recommended.,Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U

He responded really quickly and fixed my error and got them to me in time for Christmas..Excellent customer service!.I wasn't thrilled about the pricing, but everything in the world has gone up I guess, and for excellent customer service, it's a good trade off!

I would recommend this business!",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U

I had ordered 2 sweaters with a mock up design for an event I was hosting and was surprised with the quick turnaround when the order was delivered the next day. With this in mind, I placed an order for 2 more sweaters. 8 days go by and still had not received a shipping confirmation. I was getting anxious because my event was fast approaching.

When I picked up my shirts, I asked them if they print the shirts in-house. They do. So it takes no time to print it. There is no excuse for a delay after they receive the order.

Toronto Tees charges a premium to get the shirt fast. If you don't pay more, then they make you wait a week for your order. This is too long and not right. The shirts are expensive enough already.

The quality of the shirt is average. It is a typical Gildan shirt.",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U

I missed the knock as I was on a work call, but when I did open the door a nice canvas bag was left tied to my door handle with my purchase inside..It lead me to believe that these products are hand delivered by the employees themselves, as opposed to being shipped via postal services.

I then decided I only needed 9 t-shirts to be printed out. They tried to charge me $315.00 for printing 9 t-shirts for a basic quote along with a black and white photo. They don't seem to have no consideration about your situation whatsoever nor' does anyone have good team ethics, all they see is a dollar sign. Communication is poor and the environment feels sketchy.

One thing to keep in mind: If you are picking up in person, bring a friend to help or be prepared to personally carry the box of shirts to your car or to transit. The staff will not help you. Not complaining; I just hadn't considered that when I had parked my car a few blocks away.",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U

But my most recent visit to the shop on Yonge I found the staff not as friendly as in the past and the slogan ‚Äòhome of the 5 min tee' didn't really hold true. When I arrived I was the only person in the store and the first guy who greeted me was not too friendly. When I mentioned I would like to make 6 shirts, most with simple text, I was told I could not get them all at once, I would need to collect 3 of them the next day. I was the only person in the store and it was more than 1 hour til close. I was disappointed as I wanted to give them as gifts the next day and didn't have time to wait.

I was happy with the quality of the sweater along with the print. My order was ready in just 3 days!

Thanks Toronto Tees! I definitely recommend ordering from them.",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U
5747,"Great experience! Visited the store to check if they could extract a small portion of a picture and put it on a t-shirt, and 10 minutes later I left the store with exactly what I wanted. What I love about the t-shirt is that the print is not too thick and it doesn't look like it would crack or peel.
I was being helped by Trevor, a wonderful young man/powerful wizard who did his magic to make that t-shirt happen. Great customer service too - even when he was immersed in the picture modifying software, he managed to be engaging, charmingly funny and deal with my questions.
Top marks for both service and product!",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U

I was impressed with the level of politeness when speaking with them over the phone, prior to ordering online. As a brand director at my previous job, I was all about the logo placement and quality of garments being ordered for staff. I ordered a custom zip-up hoodie for my mom for Mother's Day and within the week it arrived at my house. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of garment and end-result of art work supplied.

Ethan from the Yonge street office went out of his way to let us know that, in correction to an earlier report that they didn't have medium black tees in stock, that they actually DO have them at the time. He flagged me and my old folks down the street in front of the shop and told us the pleasant news. My family's father's day was made all the more memorable thanks to me not having to return a third time for a third order.

Above all, they actually carefully inspected both of my designs and re-examined the printing results, making sure I was happy with each and everyone of them before I left the store.

5762,"Toronto Tees has the best customer service I've ever experienced - hands down.

The t-shirt I ordered arrived quickly, however, the design came out blurrier than I'd hoped. Joe had already emailed me to confirm my satisfaction, and when I responded with my concern he responded back within minutes offering a replacement. The issue ended up being that the photo I sent was too pixelated. They were able to find a better quality photo of the same design and the new shirt I received is of the highest quality. Not to mention it took only a few days for my orders to arrive, and both orders were hand delivered.

10/10 could not recommend this place more. Thank you, Toronto Tees and Joe!",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U

5768,"I always thought Toronto Tees only did one offs in their store location on Yonge St. They are even better for large quantity orders.
Even with what I'm sure are serious supply chain challenges which come with a global pandemic. Joe (the owner) dealt with our order personally. He was on top of our order and our design adjustments every step of the way. Toronto Tees got our order of 150 T-shirts out super fast and they are some of the best quality t-shirts I've seen or worn.

uploaded the artwork, sent the order through, and less that 24 hours later a brand new, stunningly reproduced graphic t-shirt was at my door.

Great customer service. When I paid online, i was given 5 days pick up time. But i called to ask that i will be in the area in the evening. They got it ready for me in 10min right in front of my eyes.
The only thing that i would have appreciated is more options.for the shirt fabric. Though the tshirt was soft but felt a little thin. I was hoping for a thicker tshirt fabric which can be preserved as a memory after my son outgrows it. I would have paid a bit more for a higher quality tshirt fabric. I wish they add 1 more options for premium tshirts.
Masks are not good. Donot fit the face well. No nose wire or ear adjustments. Would not waste money on mask.
Highly recommended fot tshirts. Can't wait to design another one for my next occasion. Thanks.",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U

I stumbled upon Toronto Tees in my search to get a design printed for my daughter.

The hoodie was printed and shipped out to us very quickly, and we received it much earlier than we had anticipated, to my daughter's delight. I was a little apprehensive about the print quality because of a poor experience with another company, but I needn't have worried; the quality of the print is excellent, printed exactly as we requested.

6135,"These guys are superb to work with! I've been getting apparel printed and ordered by them for a few years now doing bulk orders as well as one off designs for events. They're always helpful, easygoing and seem to really like what they're doing, which is what I like to see when I'm doing business with a company.

Toronto Tee's goes the extra mile to ensure that you're happy - I can think of one instance where I had given them instructions to do a black on charcoal grey, they silkscreened one and called me to report that the design was too dark/too subtle for the colour of the shirt and we went with a lighter ink. It saved me gigantic head ache and a lot of money! Aaaand they ended up looking amazing!",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U
6136,Absolutely AMAZING! Every time I go in they are great. which is why I keep going back! Last minute gifts that are perfectly customized are always so much more personal.

Thanks again Toronto Tees!,Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U
6137,"""No good. Employees don't care, don't try to help and act superior. I dealt with a very condescending kid named Trevor. Tons of attitude, high prices, don't recommend it at all""

THIS! Took the words right out of my mouth. If you plan on getting printed tees do so at another store. I sent Trevor an invoice for how much it was quoted in the online store and he refused to uphold the pricing. Trevor does not make sure your product is how you want it to be. I gave Trevor a mock up on how the picture was suppose to look like (the design on the right) and when Trevor printed it out it was smaller than what was discussed. Also if you look at the alignment between the writing and graphic are almost identical which is not what I wanted. The writing is higher than the graphic as seen on the design. When I went to ask Trevor about it, Trevor told me he needed the right measurements for the print. Why was this not purposed ahead of time? Trevor saw my mock up and said he can do it exactly as it was but how it turned out was in no way what I wanted. He did not reach out once to ask about my design and planned to charge me almost the same amount to reprint the pieces he messed up on.

TLDR: please avoid, do not recommend.

Update: There was no voicemail left, also my name is spelled Jacky. Great customer service.",Toronto Tees Custom Printed,U

When I opened the package, I realized they substituted inferior quality shirts for the ones I paid for. When I spoke with the manager he told me that he is under no obligation to tell me that he substituted a shirt! I understand the need to substitute if I was putting a time pressure on them to deliver within a certain time, but if I am willing to wait, a substitution with no warning of a substitution is a classic bait and switch scam. When you purchase with this company you have no idea what you are actually purchasing and they couldn't care less. When I asked him why he doesn't care about his customers enough to even let them know of a substitution, he said he didn't have time. Terrible customer service!

Edit: In addition to my review here, I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and was surprised to learn that I am not the only one with an unresolved complaint.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6731,"So after 4 voicemails, 2 chat attempted, multiple unanswered calls and 5 emails, finally I arrive here. This company has zero customer service. They simply don't care if they have made any issue with their orders. I ordered this shirt recently, I finally washed it - cold, and hung dry as usual.

As soon as it came out of the wash I immediately noticed that the colour of the face was yellow. It makes the singer, look sickly. Its a black man now with a yellowish-green face. It's unwearable.

I have taken a photo of my 3-year-old, original version and you can see that the face has maintained his black complexion.

I asked for a redo on this tee, at $61 shipped this is not a cheap tee to make so I expect, and have received better.

ZERO RESPONSE.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6732,"I've been using T-Shirt Elephant for 6 years now for my yearly race..Our runners just love the shirts and hats he makes. They are excellent. The product (and product suggestions/alternatives) are high quality. Jason is very easy to work with. His prices are excellent..And he's come through in the clutch for me at the same price and quality when I was delayed getting him my order. We're a small not-for-profit and a small customer, but he really makes us feel like we are special. I wouldn't go anywhere else for my Art In Motion 10K/5K/2K race shirts.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

6734,There are many things which I found great about the whole experience with T-Shirt Elephant. The selection of a wide variety of T-Shirts to match any style and quality. The easy to use design process. The rapid turn around of the product. The high quality of the T-Shirts which we selected. The great quality of the full colour printing of our logo on the shirts. We are thrilled both with the service and the quality of the finished product. We will be placing another order very soon. Thank you from the Electrical Banana!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6735,"Buyer beware:
I will say, years ago, this company was great..I ordered all my merch from them..Until now.
They made a mistake with my order (printed the wrong colour, and the colours in the logo were all bleeding together).
It was overall a terrible job.
They tried to blame me for the mistake..Even though I had ordered the same thing 4 years prior and they had done a wonderful job with it..This time they got the colour wrong, and it even varies from each shirt..It's bad enough that I won't even let my staff wear the shirts because it looks so bad and I pride myself on being a clean, professional business.
I sent photo evidence of how they messed it up..They avoided my emails and calls..Finally, I asked for a refund and they said they would reprint instead..They dragged that out for 3 months and still have yet to send me a reprint..They say ""It's going out mid next week"" and ""we will send you shipping information then"" and I have received nothing.
My order was almost $500, they messed it up and refuse to fix it or refund me.
I was trying to get my staff new shirts to wear, and 6 months later I am still out $500 and no staff shirts..We are a small business recovering from COVID and this was not a wasted expense we could afford.
I have given them plenty of business and this is how I was treated..I sent a complaint to the BBB..Hopefully no one else gets scammed.
Save your money, do not order from them..They will rob you.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6736,"I really tried to give them the benefit of the doubt.

I've had 2 separate orders with them come in fine and within a reasonable time so I won't knock that.

I made an order back in November of 2022, and I understand that the Christmas season was approaching so I buffed the time it would take print and deliver a single sweater. We're now approaching the end of January and I've sent multiple emails and chats (through their website) and have received little response and follow-through. I eventually received a response to which they didn't even at least apologize for the inconvenience. I was offered to be issued a refund or to have it reprinted and sent out the following day. I requested, the reprint since I just wanted to have the product as it was a long overdue Christmas gift. I have not heard back since, and it's been over a week. The customer service was very disappointing and I communicated that within my messages. Extremely disappointing, $70 dollars for a sweater I may not ever receive. I don't wish for this experience on anyone.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6737,We use T-Shirt Elephant for our T-Shirt and Sweatshirts every few months. We usually print some very complex graphics and the prints turn out very well every time. They are local and the prices are excellent.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6738,"A month ago, I ordered 5 t-shirts with a one colour design through the T-shirt Elephant's online system. Soon after ordering, I realized I got one size wrong and wanted to make a change to the order. It was IMPOSSIBLE to contact the company. They never replied to the email and chat, didn't pick up the phone or called back. The order arrived 8 days late. Needless to say, my size change request was ignored.

The print quality was OK, and the price was affordable, but their customer service is non-existent. Not recommended.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6739,"The process of ordering and getting proofs to getting our order on time was seamless and easy. Jason was very communicative, prompt, and responded to all queries we had. Highly recommend for any business looking for any branded apparel. We're really happy with the quality of our sweatshirts!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

I don't know whether or not someone put an extra rush on them (as I requested via email) to absolutely ensure they made it on time for when I need them, but they indeed arrived plenty early!.These shirts are for my father's 80th birthday, which will sadly be his last..T-shirt Elephant was integral in ensuring we can have as many ""special"" elements for my father's party as possible by making & expediting my order..THANK YOU!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

The prices are very competitive (I did my research) and the quality is excellent - they are super soft and have washed really well. Delivery was on time.

6747,"I had ordered shirts from here before, and they were high quality screen printed. Assuming the same, I ordered some new designs, only to find they were made with heat transfers instead. The colours were washed out, and I suspect these will not wear nearly as well as the original order which was screen printed. Considering the high unit cost, this is disappointing.

I suspect this is what happens with one-off designs, but it should be made clear to customers if that is the case.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6748,We work with T-Shirt Elephant regularly for our promotional gear needs. They have a great selection of items; the quality of the products and custom printing is always spot on; and the team is extremely helpful when we need advice selecting new products. Highly recommend!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6749,"I was pretty excited to be able to make some custom printed items for my wife; she had used your site in the past and they turned out terrific. The design process was straightforward and easy to navigate, print timeline was as stated/expected.
I was also advised that a proof would be sent for approval prior to printing; I received none, but as I had left specific notes during the ordering process, I assumed the job was simple enough.
This is direct from your website: 'Proofs - There is no document more important in the custom apparel business than a proof. Our designers can create a proof with your branding and message so you can stay professional when submitting art to clients and potential clients; we will ensure your design alignment is centred; We will also try to fix up pixelated artwork or contact you about any issue.'
Shipment was where things began to sour..The tracking number provided was incorrect, after a week and a half I sent an email requesting the correct tracking information..I still haven't received a reply. But the package arrived ‚Äì quelle surprise!
After inspecting the shirt there were several very noticeable design/print quality issues. I called your customer number but was unable to speak with anyone so left a voice message, which has yet to be returned..I sent an email clearly explaining the issues, with pictures of the deficiencies. Again ‚Äì no response. I tried the ‚Äúlive chat‚Äù option, but of course there isn't anyone live responding. The android's final reply was that someone would contact me. I waited 24 hours - again no response from your company. I called again, leaving a second voice message indication how disappointing the lack of customer service is. I waited another 24 hours, still no return contact. This now brings us to this horrible review.
It is unfortunate that my experience has forced me into this action. As I explained in my correspondence to you, the one item is to be worn to a Christmas party this weekend; she will still wear that shirt but the shoddy QC from your end will be evident for all to see, and make no mistake, everyone will made aware of your company name.
Word of mouth is an extremely powerful advertising tool.

UPDATE - it has been 13 days since my items arrived.still haven't received any responses for any of my voice messages and emails.
I have since read a ton of these reviews; shame on me for not prior to making my order..But it ""always happens to the other guy"".
How on earth can a company like this stay in business; that would be the day I would let customers have a terrible experience and bash my company like this and do absolutely zero to make things right.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

6754,Buyer beware! Ordered ATC shirts for a staff order to see how this company was at fulfilling orders as we wanted to use a Canadian company. We received a poorer quality shirt than what we had ordered and when we contacted them on it they replied that it was in their terms and conditions that they could choose to substitute with other products of equal or greater quality without contacting..What a scam this is in my opinion and I wonder how many people have been taken advantage of by this one-sided loophole that only benefits them especially when the substitution is of lesser quality and something that we would have canceled if we were informed of the change they made with any notification at all.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6755,"This is so confusing - last year, May 2022, I placed an order and the customer service I got was amazing. Very fast, super helpful, great price and the quality was excellent. Then a few months later, we had another order so I contact them. which went fine for the first few email exchanges. then as of mid November, nothing. I emailed, called, used the chatbot, probably 20-30 times, and nothing. Having to re-do the entire process with another company was not cool, and I'm so confused as to what happened. I'm certainly not using TE in the future though.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

Today I can say that I have recieved atleast PART of my order from t-shirt elephant. I am grateful to say thart what was delivered was the largest part of the order and it was well done/ liked by everyone. However, part of my order that is missing (about $225 worth of product) has been very hard to get the company to notice. I have emailed and tried their 'chat bot' which is a dead end. Even their scoial medias do not allow messaging. There seems to be no way to communicate with this company and this is disheartening. I definitely will be reaching out the BBB if I do not hear from this company soon on my missing order components.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

I ordered a custom design sweatshirt for the holidays about a year ago, which I simply dragged my art onto the design area of the website, and the outcome was fantastic. The screen print remains just as vibrant as when I first received it (as seen in the photo), and the shirt itself was surprisingly fuzzy on the inside! I also plan to order another design for a group of people soon. Although the price is a little more than what I'd usually pay for clothing, and the shipping takes awhile depending on your order, these are custom designs and you do in fact get your bang for your buck.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6769,"We use T-Shirt Elephant as our provider for all are T-Shirt and apparel. We've worked together for almost 8 years now and they've been the back-bone of our business. We are both Canadian businesses, so it's been a pleasure to continue to support them.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6770,"This company is a JOKE. Emailed and attempted to call customer service multiple times. They ghosted on responses once I made a point that their product was subpar and no where near the mocked up design. Save your time and money and go somewhere else that will actually respond and take responsibility for their lack of expertise.
I've used this company in the past for toques. when I went to make a second order with a new design. again LAZILY they just reprinted my old design again. This time they actually took responsibility for their error and sent new toques with my new design.

Should have known to not use them again after that, but here we are. Almost $800 lost on a box of merch I don't even want to give out for free because it looks so pedestrian.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6771,Delivered less than the quantity we ordered and paid for. Don't answer emails or phone calls to address problems with the order. Many items had loose threads and quality is bad. Do not recommend.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6772,"Terrible customer service. We made a team order for hoodies, and the first order came all uniform. The next order for new players was placed with the exact same product, exact same layout, was noted that it was to match the original order. They sent us a poor quality print and when I got in touch to have it replaced with the same quality as the other hoodies they said it was my fault that the print was so poor because I didn't request a certain type of printing. I was never made aware that there were different types of printing, and why would I want a poorer quality print? They said the manager reviewed the quality and said that it was fine. It looks completely different from the first order, and.looked faded before it was ever washed. You can see the difference in the photos. One was crisp and one is not. The kicker for all of this is that a local company offered the same product with same printing for HALF the price of T-Shirt Elephant. What a rip off. Find a local family owned company to support and take your business elsewhere.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6773,"They are very responsive, easy and quick. The shirts I ordered came out perfect both times I ordered.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6774,"They did a horrendous job on our shirts and are refusing to get back to me. The shirts looked really washed out and our logos almost looked bleached on most shirts. The logos that weren't bleached were just completely different colours than what we asked for. Save yourself the time and look elsewhere for your Custom T-shirt needs. You won't be able to get a hold of anyone if they do mess up.

Edit: It's only fair to share the good things as well. The company ended up making it right and sent us a brand new batch free of charge and they look 10x better. Thanks for looking out!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

6777,"Spoke to them via their online-chat app and had a handshake agreement to the timeline in regards to production and shipping, as we were trying to hit a milestone. Basically ""We know it says 20 days, but it'll be printed and out the door way sooner"". Once the order was placed and paid, that agreement disappeared, and even though the conversation was acknowledged, they reprimanded me for even inquiring as to production time and subsequent shipping date.

Chelsea, the person with the title ""customer service"", provided a series of contradictory comments via email in regards to timeline and my original order (apparently Estimated Arrival Date means when they'll actually ship). The original chat was ""we'll turn this around super quick"" to ""we have fourteen days and it's only day twelve, so back off"". When questioned on Day 14 as to the status was told weekends don't count - even though I went by her numbers.

Hell, at one point Chelsea sent me a screenshot of their website that shipping is an estimated timeframe and to tell me it was late because Canada Post was having a tough go with the pandemic. Mind you, they'd not even printed the shirts at this point - so super curious as to how it was the postal system's fault?

Long story short, these arrive eventually. Three simple white text on black t-shirts that cost just over $70 all in. Wicked expensive but hey, it was a joke gift of sorts, for a milestone that was already six days past, but was happy they'd arrived.

However, the print job was sub-par. Thick, undefined edges, paint that allowed for the fabric to show through, and letters that began to flake off when lightly rubbed with my fingers.

Asked for a refund and was told: ""This falls within our acceptable printing guidelines. We will not be issuing a reprint or a refund for this. This matter is closed.""

Are you serious? Imagine I treated my clients like this? Imagine any of us would? A server that brings you hamburger instead of steak and when queried responds with not only ""this falls within our acceptable serving guidelines"" but ends with ""go eff yourself, this matter is closed"".

This was not only a fun little gift, but a DTG supplier test run, and man alive lesson learned to run from these folks. They've got nice branding, a decent online interface and cool packaging - but their customer service is total trash and that end product is an embarrassment.

So you've paid money for a product or service to a level of quality that you'd not received, and the people who took that money tell you that not only they think this kind of poor craftsmanship falls within their ""acceptable printing guidelines"" but that you can't discuss a reprint, a refund or any other avenue.

""This matter is closed.""

Wow. Both the production time, customer service and ultimately the product itself is just piss poor. Whoever screen-printed this has little to no talent, or needs to find their manager to walk them through the basics again. or just doesn't care. Three scenarios that don't work in a payment-for-skill based business.

Can't recommend giving zero business to T-shirt Elephant enough. Shop elsewhere.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

The first couple of years customer service was great and the product was good and it was always delivered in a timely manner.

This year the customer service has been atrocious. I have to say this is the worst customer experience I've dealt with in my 25 years alive and I'm not exaggerating. There's simply no way to get ahold of anyone at the company.

I'm giving 2 stars due to past performance being acceptable. But it's super easy to tell the company is having major internal issues right now. Supply chain issues are understandable in this time. Customer service issues are a lack of care and/or poor systems.

6782,"Save yourself the trouble and please don't order from here. Calling their 1-800 number will lead straight to voicemail and emails to their orders account will never be returned. The 14 day guaranteed shipping is a flat lie and I was only able to get my product (still delayed by two weeks from the guaranteed date) when I called my credit card to report for fraud. The fraud division submitted the report and advised that if they don't respond back within 30 days or something I'd get my money back, and only then did I receive my order after 8 days passed. When I placed the order for a team baseball hat, it mentioned that all hat orders will be embroidered by default but some complex designs may need to be digitally printed of which they will confirm before printing. My design only had a simple ‚ÄúS‚Äù on it and it came digitally printed. Also the wrong hat selection too. Now I wish they haven't sent this at all so that I'd get my full refund back from my credit card but I guess they didn't want to be filed for fraud so they sent my order out of spite with the bare minimum effort using the cheapest selection for the design.

I made an order a month ago and was supposed to have a delivery last week at the latest. 10 emails, and 5 voicemails have not been answered. Just give me a refund. I will be filing a police report and a chargeback with my credit card, although I feel my $300 is gone.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6786,"DO NOT BUY HERE! IT IS A SCAM. After reading comments here, looks like i am not the only one who got scammed..My story: I purchased 3 pro performance shirts (2 designs in total). The 1st design came out good, as expected. On the more expensive 2 shirts (2nd design), they replaced my selected design with a different shirt. It was extremely poor quality and fit and most importantly a completely different design. I inquired with support and all they did was try to offer me 20% off the 2 shirts that were bad. 20% off something i didn't choose to buy or want. No one ever communicated to me that there would be a design change, as their policy stated. The 2 bad shirts are completely worthless..Look at the attached pics for what i ordered vs what i got.
Imagine going into a car dealership and paying $100k for the higher end model and when you come pick it up, they give you the $30k model, without telling you anything before you came then offer you 20% off. That's what happened here. I will be taking this guy to court so that others won't get scammed again. Jason Sterling is the apparent business owner. He is on Facebook.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6787,"Please do not order from this place. This is my first time ordering from this company and it was the worst.

The customer service is absolutely non-responsive (phone number, emailing, the chat box, you name it). Don't even bother trying to call them because it will only lead you to a voicemail every time. The quickest response I got was through email, and that was from Robyn Atherton who only responded to answer why there was a delay in my order and about my tracking number (but this is after I had to email them multiple times for them to respond back).

On top of that, one of the hoodies (which had no designs or anything) I received was a faulty: there was a hole, the finishing was not neat, loose threads, and the sewings were not straight.

Also, when designing the crewnecks on the website, the design I have made were large and it fit the crewnecks nicely. But when I received my order the design was wayyyy smaller (like embarrassingly smaller) which now looks pathetic.

Considering that this place has a 3.8 rating, and that a friend of mine recommended this place to me. I was expecting good customer service and the products being designed the way I wanted it to be.

In conclusion, don't order from this place. Just don't. I spent the last month and this past few weeks working on designing, ordering, and struggling to get a response from the company just for my order to have a delay and for the design to look wack.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6788,My first order with Tshirt Elephant was a bit scary. I thought I had been scammed because there was hardly any communication once my order was placed. I eventually got my order so I forgave and forgot. Placed a second order hoping this time would be better - wrong. Second order was far worse. I had to send 5 emails asking if they received my payment and still haven't got a response. Imagine having to beg a company to let you know if your order has been processed. I guess they don't want my money. I do not recommend ordering from this company. The print is decent but the quality of the clothing is awful. One wash and the hoodies/tshirts are threading all over the place. Non-existant customer service. I work for a large business local to Calgary and we would've consistently placed large volume orders but now we are looking elsewhere.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6789,"If I could give a zero I would - extremely disappointed by the zero customer service provided. When I made an order for school purposes, there was a slight mistake in the order that we caught immediately after placing. Tried calling, emailing and using their text feature for a week solid and never got any response from anyone, despite their claims of having customer service daily throughout the week by phone message, and the automatic reply to my emails stating they would get back to me within 24 hours. Never did get a hold of anyone and when I got my order almost a month later it was not what I wanted and poor quality. Since I will not charge my students for this I am now personally out almost $300. Will never order from them again. Very disappointed",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6790,"I had ordered previously and had a great experience. This time when I attempted to order additional matching shirts for the team it was awful.
Knowing my order was from several years ago, and trying to make it easier on the company, I enclosed a copy of my original order and pictures of one of the original jerseys with instructions I wanted them to match as perfectly as possible. When I got the new jerseys they didn't match. They were vinyl decals instead of silk screenedand and the font was in lowercase instead of all uppercase.
Upon contacting them to ask about a remedy, I was first told they had never silkscreened performance wear and that they matched the jerseys as best they could. I then emailed saying that I did have silkscreened jerseys and the font didn't match and this could have been avoided by showing a proof. They said they never show proofs for names and numbers on jerseys and i should have verified their methods of printing before I ordered. The remedy they offered was for me to sepify what I wanted more clearly on my next order (i guess copies of my previous order and photos of the jerseys i wanted mached wete not specific enough).There will be no next order.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6791,Ordered $1800 worth of shirts and hats after using this company in the past. The logo on the shirts was missing half of the printed words. Terrible customer service with slow reply times. No reasonable offer of making things right. Will be taking my business elsewhere.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6792,These guys knocked it out of the park again! This is the third year that the Art In Motion 10K/5K/2K has used Jason and his crew to do our race shirts and each year they have been amazing. We added some custom embroidered hats and they were better than I expected.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6793,"I spoke AT LENGTH with Jason who was extremely short in his emails but I tolerated it as it seemed he was giving me a reasonable price. Eventually we agreed on a final quote per T-shirt. I took orders, charged my customers and then provided him with the complete order only to be ignored and ghosted. I sent 4 emails. Called 3 times and left a voicemail which all went unanswered. I find this extremely unprofessional and apparently this ""customer service"" rep has done this before as I can see the review before mine went through the exact same experience.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this unprofessional business.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6794,"TERRIBLE SERVICE, product not as advertised, not as promised. save your money and buy elsewheres.
While my 2018 purchase went well, this year was quite the opposite. Jason was very responsive while we ordered our shirts, but after they arrive, the company is completely silent. Our order was not fulfilled in full, we paid for items which we did not receive, and we have heard radio silence from our multiple voicemails and multiple emails since early June. I will have to seek refund/re-imbursement for items not fulfilled as purchased. Wish me luck, LOL.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

The website is easy to navigate and they offer a lot of items. The prices get a lot better as you increase the quantities. Concerning the product itself. During my design process on their website, I made sure that everything was centered. However, my order seems to have the print a bit tilted to the left side - writing is not straight like you would expect. I made 15x shirts, some are worst than others, but pretty much all seems tilted. The delivery time is about 10 to 15 days; which is fairly good.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6797,"Unfortunately, my experience with them on the customer service side has been terrible. I ordered 15 pieces (t-shirts, long sleeves and hoodies). Very satisfied with the shirts and long sleeves. However, the color on the hoodies are extremely different from the other items in my order and the print quality is significantly worse.

I immediately contacted them to inform them of my issue and even after supplying pictures of the obvious drop in quality on the hoodies, they refused to accommodate me in any way whatsoever, stating they're not issuing reprints or any sort of refund/credit on print quality basis.

Extremely dissatisfied, will never order from them again.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

My order was processed right away, and I received it less than a week later.

However, when I showed them what I wanted, they simply did it the way they wanted it. I sent them a picture telling them exactly what I wanted and they picked a different font from the one in the picture I sent because ‚Äúthey have standard fonts‚Äù?. The funny part was that the picture I sent them was a previous order so there shouldn't be any problem getting it exactly the way it was supposed to be. they refused to do it the right way and told me to next time order with the font I want.

6806,"Really disappointed with this experience. Rude client service. We ordered 6 matching tshirts for our friends for an upcoming vacation. The fit was extremely small. Their website doesn't tell you they fit small, so order a bigger size. They said ""we must not be XL"" and we should have ordered XXL. I have never put an XXL on in my life. I am barely an XL but these don't fit me. They won't do anything to make this right. Hopefully they realize that good customer service goes a long way. This could have been a 5 star review that helped them attract customers. Now, I hope they lose 20 customers over this. Buyer beware.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

6810,I have ordered from this company before and recieved good service but this time I ordered 10 custom shirts over 2 months ago. The first time I ordered the shipping status said it was delivered when I was not and when I brought this to customer service they said they would try to ship to a new address that I provided (both of these addresses have been used by this company in the last 2 years so I know they work). Fast forward another month and the second shipment said that it's been sent back to the sender. Very frustrating experience that still has yet to be resolved. Would not recommend this company. I'll update this review if this is ever resolved.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6811,"I have ordered several custom one-off t-shirts and tank tops through T-Shirt Elephant over the last.four or five years. I am consistently impressed with thier quality, speed, service, and pricing. Buying one-off shirts may be expensive, but the quality more than makes up for it, even the shirts I have from years ago are in excellent condition, no holes in the fabric, no fading or cracking of the image. I will definitely be using them again in the future.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6812,DO NOT USE: I recently ordered an American Apparel 50/50 shirt and received a completely different shirt than what I ordered that was of significantly worse quality. I needed this shirt for an event and even super rushed the order that charged a 50% additional fee. I reached out to the co-owner Jason who told me they have the right to switch the shirt type at any time without warning and to check the FAQ next time. Not only did I not receive the right shirt but the customer service was extremely poor and non-sympathetic despite the company's error. I highly recommend you look at alternative companies or as Jason says read the fine print FAQ and if your lucky you will get what you ordered.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V

Further more when the shirts ran out and we needed more not once but two times in the same night , Jason was to our rescue..Such a great company and great staff. I dont know what we would have done if it wasn't for the care and understanding of the staff of this company..Shirts chosen and designed by me were done to the t on these shirts.

I purchased two different styles and texture of shirts, and both were very much to my approval. When I submitted the order, they stated a specific date it would be ready, and I believe it was in the couriers hands before that date, so efficiency and being prompt are always a good thing to be associated with a company.

They claimed they had already ordered the t -shirts. Really? That's a super lame excuse for a t-shirt company that would sell them as it was pre-Xmas rush! I asked many times for a rep to call - never happened. No replies to emails. Design was messed up on our shirts and could not sell them.

The above is from my first time placing an order. My most recent repeat business order came back looking so good it brought a tear of joy to my eye. The colors were super-saturated and the registration of the screens was tight!

I placed a small order (7 custom sweatshirts) on Dec 2nd last year with a 'guaranteed date' of Dec 22..At the time of my order the website still showed that I could pick up locally, which I was hoping would be my back-up if it wasn't delivered in time for Christmas..After I emailed customer service to confirm this after my order, I received a templated email saying pick-up not available due to Covid..I tried calling and the phone was never picked up.

Dec 22 comes and goes, no delivery and no communication from the company..I send an email enquiry, and I get no response..Christmas comes and goes, and still no response or delivery..I try calling, and again, phone only goes to voicemail..I finally leave a voicemail January 7th enquiring about my order..I get no phone call back, and then finally I get an 2-line email effectively saying ""sorry, order is pushed to front of queue and will be shipped rush""..They gave no explanation or acknowledgement that they must've forgot about my order (I presume). And yet still, by January 19th I received nothing and had to follow-up yet again..They never responded, but eventually by late January I got the order (which was anti-climatic, as the people who were suppose to get them at Christmas were no longer in the province).

I'm not sure if I was overlooked as my order was so small and personal, and not a corporate order, but I was very frustrated and upset by the whole experience..If the company cannot handle smaller-personal orders, or covid is disrupting the productivity, then they should clearly communicate that with their prospective customers..The lack of communication was just unacceptable..I even sent an email to customer service after my order was finally delivered, setting out how disappointing the process was and never got a response.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

The shirts I ordered were a better quality material and cut than I had expected, the fit was great! However, I came to T-Shirt Elephant for printed shirts, so this review is based on the quality of printing. The window within which you can design is limited.

I work as a graphic designer, and know that the art was ""camera ready"", in other words nothing needed to be changed to print them.
I selected the apparel that I wanted, nothing special, two grey Gildan shirts.
It took 5 weeks to arrive.
The website does not tell you how long to expect to have to wait, until after you have paid them.
The quality of the print was decent, and the shirts look great. I have no complaints about the products. My two star rating was entirely due to the utter lack of transparency regarding how long this was going to take. Elephant ignoring my email requests for an update (I got one notice/ reply to my queries in the five week period).
When the items did arrive, there was no ""Sorry this took so long"" email, or any offering of an explanation.
I had a series of designs, for multiple touring bands, and orders in the hundreds that were to follow this first small run/ test printing.
I ended up going with Jak prints out of Cleveland. With import fees, and shipping internationally included, their prices are similar, and often less than Elephant. I wished to use a CA company, but not when it takes five weeks to print two shirts.

The order was supposed to be delivered within 2 weeks as per contract. Of course I understand the current situation and I did allowed an extra time for delivery, I was okay with the delay, however there was NO communication, no Order updates, no emails, no.messages sent to me about the production times etc. It has been a month and no delivery. Finally after 1 month the package comes in (after I sent 2 emails) and 1/2 of the order is still missing! Website says the order is completed, but I only got half of the products ordered. I emailed customer service three times, tried to chat with them online, and called twice, and I am unable to reach the customer service. No one responds to your emails.

Also - QUALITY IS BAD - the printing is very light and not high-quality ink, the logo will go away after few washes, I'm sure. The embroidery is so bad, the thread is pulling already in one of the product, which means the quality of the supplies is low. I ordered from other stores before and it was never such bad quality.

I sized my logo and placed on mock up, didn't see where I could add measurement and logos came on products ridiculously HUGE. About 4"" wider than I had assumed based on mock-up. You never see logos that gigantic. Can't wear, looks so silly. Wasn't happy, emailed and all they offered was 10% off my next order. No thank you.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6846,"I was able to order only one shirt which was a nice selling feature. The other positive was that the shirt was completed and shipped to me within 5 days. Very fast service. However, there were a few issues.

First, after ordering, I realized I made a small error on what was to be printed. As soon as I realized (within 4 hours of purchase) I sent them an email and tried calling the contact number to simply add an '. I tried re-calling the number for the next few days and was re-routed to some marketing agency and no one answered back. My email was left unanswered as well. There seems to be no way to reach this company.

The second issue I had is with the overall quality of the shirt. I ordered a large, yet the sizing seems to be way bigger than normal. The shirt is a little shorter than a normal large but waaay wider. It gives the person a nice 'skinny fat' look, which should not be a look anyone is trying to achieve.

Honestly, I can overlook the poor customer service if the quality of material was good. I made the initial mistake and ultimately that's on me. However, I would not recommend the shirt in terms of quality either. Overall, a bit disappointing.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

I got an order email that had pictures of my shirt design. Problem was email only showed the front of the shirt. I emailed customer service about this to make sure they had my back of shirt design as it was not in email. They got back to me within 1 day and assured me everything was good. The shipping cost seems high to me, especially if you want rush shipping. 14 business days time frame that they guarantee for delivery. My shirt showed up after 9 business days so I was quite happy about that. When I opened up shirt to check it out I was very happy. It turned out better then I thought it would.

The quality of the print is great and our students loved it. The shirt is thick and feels like great quality. We pre-washed them all and they look great. Will definitely be ordering from them soon.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6851,Shipping can take some time but IT IS WORTH IT - Great quality and alignment! I think it is a fair a totally fair shipping for the the product you get!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6852,So very pleased with the quick and efficient service I received..Very good quality shirts and they were a hit at our Volunteer Appreciation Night.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6853,"Their design web app is pretty easy to use and fairly detailed enough to make specific requests on the design and colour. So thumbs up for that.

However, came the time when I wanted to place an order, their website went down!
Nothing would load, so that wasn't pleasant at all.

I did email them about it and they were quite responsive..It was fixed the next day and placed my order with no issues.

T-shirts shipped within less than 2 weeks, so that was great..The quality of the shirts were great, I ordered 150 of the Gildan Performance Tees, the colour (i chose athletic gold) was more like a yellow rather than a gold..Time will tell if they wash out over time.

One thing though is that their prices are competitive along with great customer service, so that already won me over other companies.

Overall, I had a good experience with them!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6854,"Just received my third order from T-Shirt Elephant..The t-shirts look great and the order arrived early, which was perfect as the projected delivery date was a little too close to the day I needed them for my comfort.

I will definitely order from this company again..Very satisfied.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6855,Poor customer service. I ordered my package long long ago still haven't received it. The customer support will not help me further with my issues says it's not their responsibility once Canada post picks it up. I needed my jackets I ordered for a event. They never showed up. I was not offered any sort of refund or discount for my time and trouble. I payed for a product to be delivered within a time frame it did not arrive. The manager then told the customer support ‚Äú What I have relayed to you is the guidelines that have been provided to me by my manager. We have considered this matter closed and we will not be engaging further.‚Äú DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY. You can find more reviews about this company on other review sites.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6856,DO NOT ORDER SHIRTS FROM HERE. It is a scam company - they will take your money but the shirts will never arrive. They likely paid for the positive reviews on here.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6857,"Very satisfied with T-Shirt Elephant! It was my first time using their services, and I would order from them again. I ordered a collection of personalized jackets for a high school volleyball team and they look great! I had some issues with choosing sizes during my order online, but they were very helpful in their support to correct the order. I was also unsure about the estimated delivery date, as I am on the west coast. To my surprise, I actually received them a few days early!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6858,"It was easy to design my own shirt, I put in an order with multiple colours, and I received 25+ shirts in about a week! Quality of the shirts was exactly as expected and the design came out perfectly. They also responded quickly and kindly to all of my questions. Would definitely recommend.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6859,I have had exceptional customer service from T-Shirt Elephant. Every question was answered quickly and efficiently and I loved the final product so much that I ordered more of the same for a different event. I would highly recommend them.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6860,"I wanted to order from a Canadian company. Although quick, in the remarks for the design I asked for writing on the back and the background removed on the picture I submitted. I received confirmation with those notes. Then my sweatshirt came with neither done. When I emailed customer service I was offered 10% off my next order. I said this doesn't help what I paid for this order. She said you have to read the fine print. Some shirts can't be done. But you weren't billed for writing on the back. So now I have a shirt that cost good money that isn't what I wanted. Lesson learned read everything on their site before ordering. I guess custom remarks don't matter. Will never order from them again",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6861,Purchased custom hoodies for my family as Christmas gifts and they turned out better than I could have imagined. Quality of the hoodies and the printed designs are perfect. Would love to create more designs to purchase in the future!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6862,"Placed my order on may 5th is is may 27th I did not get a confirmation email. I had no luck in getting in contact with someone who actually works here.
Who knows if I'll ever get the products I spent $300.00 I am not a happy customer by any means.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6863,"I was very satisfied with the quality of the jerseys I ordered. The sizing was good and the logos and numbers looked great. Two of the jerseys in my order were delivered without the logo, but with one quick email they sent me two new jerseys with the logo to replace the two without, free of charge. The only negative thing I could say about this order was the delivery time was a week longer than it had stated it would be when I placed the order.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6864,"I placed my second order with T shirt Elephant just recently and I ordered about 20 tank tops. The material and quality of the tank that I ordered was really nice. However when I ordered online, I expanded my logo for my business very large on the front of the tanks and received the shirts with the print extremely small and hardly noticeable..The first time I ordered, I had placed an order for a bunch of Gildan Sweaters with the logo and they turned out great. The printed logo was a nice screen print (exactly what I wanted) and they were done very well..I would order the sweaters again for sure but I was not happy at all with the turnout of the tanks unfortunately. The print on the tanks looked like it had been sprayed on and some logos were very clear, others were fading already and not all the same colour.

The shipping I thought took extremely long. I ordered the tanks the last week of June and didn't receive my order until really late July beginning of August.

I had spent a lot of money for the tanks and was so excited to receive them as I sell them at my facility. Since my last experience, I am a little bit scared to place another order.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6865,"Terrible print quality! Avoid at all costs!

A proof was never received when ordering and there was no quality control in processing the order. The sweaters received were completed in such a poor manner. I cannot have my employees in outfit this atrocious!

I contacted their support team, who did nothing to rectify their poor quality. I want a refund for my product or better quality prints of the same design and quantity.

One star is being generous! If there were negative stars this business would take the cake",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6866,Not only are the shirts we ordered fantastic the team at T-Shirt Elephant went out of their way to make sure that our shirts arrived in time for our fundraising event! Thank you so much team!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6867,I placed an order for about 25 T-shirts for a school dance club and I was extremely satisfied with my order! The price was very reasonable (had compared to several other sites) and the shipping was super fast! It was expected to be 15 days but I got it a week from my order date! I would highly recommend to Canadian customers since you don't need to deal with extra customs/duties charges and longer shipping times. I was also happy to see they accept Visa Debit. My only critic of my t-shirt quality is some loose threads found on a total of 3 shirts in my large order. Overall I am very happy and will definitely be ordering from T-Shirt Elephant again!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6868,I am pleased with the service and the product I received from T- Shirt Elephant..Everything came as ordered and the quality of the material is very good. I had to call customer service when the shirts did not arrive on the day expected but I received excellent service and an acceptable explanation..They were so busy with orders that production got a little behind..Understandable when you provide this type of product. I was assured of a delivery date before we needed the shirts and they arrived as promised..I especially liked the fact that you could order different designs and any color in one order without a minimum number or an extra charge..Free shipping is great too..Thanks T-Shirt Elephant for making our family celebration a little more special!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6869,"I ordered 2 sweaters and received them with defects, completely unusable. Unfortunately, the customer service team was not knowledgeable enough to resolve my issue and refused to provide a refund/re-print. Instead, they asked the customer (me) to order another set of sweaters at a price.

I understand that process of printing may issues here and there, my critical review mainly stems from their lack of management in their customer service. Customer service is incentivized on blaming customers to brush off any issues rather than actually ""resolving"" the issues.

As a business owner, my review is in not doing business with TShirt Elephant due to their lack of technical and customer service management.

6870,"I ordered 100 t-shirts for the first time from T-shirt Elephant for a local surf event. The website was super easy to use, the t-shirts came in two weeks and looked AMAZING. We are all so happy with them, we will definitely be ordering again! The only downside was the price. After the fact I was able to find a much cheaper price but I am still very happy with our order.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6871,The graphics turned out very well. Wish they would have an option for longer sizes. The t shirts we're given to some taller people and looked too short on them. Many athletes are taller now so offering taller sizes would allow us to use them for future t-shirt designs.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6872,"First it was the only company I found that would let me order just 1 shirt.
Second, easy to design and create the shirt I wanted
Third, quality screen print (not the sticker style from out of country companies)
Fourth, made and shipped to my door within 2 weeks (a week earlier than quoted);
Issue, my mistake was not reading the material and thinking I ordered a cotton or cotton blend.it was polyester :( Nothing to do with the company, but not what I thought I ordered.
Over all I would use them again, but read the fine print on what shirts are what material",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6873,The T-shirt arrived quickly and as designed so that was good but immediately I felt there was something wrong with the fabric. I ordered a 100% cotton T-shirt and the one I received is 50% polyester. That's a HUGE mistake/discrepancy and now my husband is leaving in one week for Germany with this family gift ( we plan to all sign it) for his very terminally ill brother and the quality and comfort of the fabric are important. I'm not happy about it at all.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6874,The t-shirt was very good quality including the image and text. It has been washed many times and is still in perfect condition. Shipping was also super quick. It came before the estimated time of arrival. Awesome experience with this company,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6875,"The purpose of my review is to let others know about how disappointed I am with the service that I received with their customer service. I had ordered sweatshirts with logo for my staff. I received the sweatshirts without the logo print. When I emailed about my surprise, the response I received was ‚Äúyou should have known that there was no logo print because of the price you paid‚Äù. I was shocked with this response. Where's the compassion and understanding there, let alone acknowledging the customer? What kind of core value does this business has? I also realized that the sweatshirts were oversized once which was my mistake that I did not pay attention to the sizing. So I asked them if I can return the 6 garments and would purchase a more expensive brand of sweatshirts that fits better for my staff with the logo. Apparently I cannot do that. The only concern of this company is money and not the happiness of their customers. I went to 4imprint.ca and was so surprised to see their core value right at their home page which is to make sure their customers are happy with the products. But t-Shirt Elephant does not care if their customers are not satisfied with the products.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6876,Amazing sweaters. I had 2 done for direct support professional and everyone at my job is very excited to order. I will be getting shirts done next. You guys are amazing. It's worth the price it's better if you are buying more then 2 but I am happy,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6877,"I have had a very positive experience with T-Shirt Elephant. They are one of the few Canadian print on demand companies and have been excellent to work with. I mostly interact with Rachel who is phenomenal. She always responds to me in a timely manner and addresses my questions/concerns. I highly recommend this company!

Edit: I had a great experience with t-shirt elephant at the very beginning but customer service and quality control have significantly decreased in the last month or so. I received several garments that were printed incorrectly. In fact, just yesterday I received a garment that was printed incorrectly for the THIRD time which is mind blowing. All my orders were delivered past the estimated delivery date as well.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6878,I ordered aprons and ball caps for an event..The ordering process was straightforward including adding and positioning the logo..Communication of confirmation and shipping was very good..When the order arrived I was very happy with the quality of all of the items..I will definitely.order again..Very good value and service.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6879,"I ordered a sweatshirt and hat. I contacted agents over chat to confirm that my order would be fine and shipped out. I actually spoke to two seperate chat agents to confirm that my designs were good to go (which they conveniently cannot find in their system apparently). I received an email multiple days after my order was placed to tell me the hat could not be made. When I asked to cancel my order, which was a suggestion offered by the agent, they told me my sweatshirt had already shipped a while ago and was being delivered. I have never received a tracking number or anything to this regard.
The agent told me that I could not cancel my order. which is ridiculous. I did not agree to pay for half of an order. Or pay to ship a single item.
They told me if I shipped it back it would be at my own expense, and NOW the item says delivered but it's not here.
This is by far one of the worst experiences I have had with a customer service team.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

6883,"There's two HUGE elephants in the room with T-Shirt Elephant: their glitched online ordering system and their customer service. I ordered a custom t-shirt for Father's Day to say ‚ÄúWORLD'S DOPEST DAD‚Äù. The apostrophe in ‚ÄòWorld's' was not showing up in the preview box; rather, there was a large space between the last two letters, so I kindly emailed customer service to ensure it would be printed properly. They assured me they would add a note to the work order, so they clearly acknowledged the preview glitch. Unfortunately, I received the shirt and they did NOT include the apostrophe, so it read ‚ÄúWORLD S DOPEST DAD‚Äù - the exact error I was trying to avoid. I emailed customer service to inquire about reprinting, they responded with the following: ‚ÄúWe cannot guarantee that order notes will be followed after the order is placed. All I had confirmed was that the note was added. As we printed this to order, we cannot issue a reprint or a refund‚Äù. I then requested to escalate the situation, and was met with the same, repeat response from the same customer service representative. I'm beyond disappointed, and will be contacting my credit card company to dispute the charge if they continue to deny my requests to speak to someone who could actually help. Their customer service deserves 0 stars. Get your custom T-shirts literally anywhere else.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6884,"Excellent customer service!.Very happy with the print quality and shipping times..I did run into an issue with the sizing on the t-shirt I ordered not matching the size chart (and not fitting) - but when I got in touch with customer service, they reprinted the design on another brand and shipped it back out to me for free..Happy customer here!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6885,"There were a few things that had gone wrong with my order. The ""guaranteed on-time"" was missed but I was willing to overlook that due to the holidays in order to get a good product into my teams hands. Once I received the product I noticed the toques were very small and the color was slightly faded. These toques would be good for youth or toddlers but not adults. They definitely do not fit adult men and most women. I ordered enough toques for two teams and we found that they didn't fit 98% of our employees.

After a bit of back and forth with t-shirt elephant they did make this right for us. We got a new order of toques in pretty quickly and they fit the team very well. I appreciate a company who will follow through to ensure the customer is satisfied with the end product.

6886,"I have not even received order yet but the customer service was so awful that I feel compelled to warn others. They need to drop whoever is doing their user support. They are obviously losing a lot of business due to this. This was my first order and I emailed in for an update on shipping only to be told that once the order leaves their facility, it is on me to contact shippers. The emails just got nastier and ruder from there. Literally all they had to do was assure me that it was on the way. I have rarely ever crapped on a user support rep because their jobs are hard but this one really rubbed me the wrong way. Just a complete and total lack of any business sense or decorum. My first order will be my last now, thanks 100% to ""Chelsea"".",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6887,"The website claims that all orders are professionally reviewed, and that customer satisfaction is guaranteed..However, the text on one of my shirts fell outside of the printing border, and I didn't notice..There was no warning on the website, and obviously no professional reviewed it..Also, the printing notes I included were ignored..I emailed the company saying I was not satisfied, and they will not reprint my shirt..I will not be using this company for future orders.

They also would not tell me how they honour their policy of ‚Äúcustomer satisfaction guaranteed‚Äù or the ‚Äúfact‚Äù that the designs are all professionally reviewed..Instead, I was told that my ticket is now closed.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

Instead I received some cheap polyester shirt that feels like a thicker version of slip material. I acknowledge that I should have read the fine print on the fabric when I bought them but it didn't even occur to me that anyone would even make a nylon baseball shirt (this isn't a league jersey).

Their website is great to see your designs on the product and position them etc. Pity about the remainder.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6896,"READ B4 PURCHASE - BEWARE.

My team submitted an order and had an extremely poor experience. Their website states that they have senior graphic designers on standby to double check orders. My take away from the experience was: bad service, hardly any communication/support, and even less of a care for the customer.

1. There were parts of the designs that they double stitched and other parts with a single stitch causing an incongruent image with various parts that were left unrecognizable compared to the original design. SOLUTION - Work with your customer.
2. Each item was of different quality. Some were better stitched than others. SOLUTION - Work with your customer and be transparent.
3. They provided no tracking number and no real notification other than when the order was placed. I had to reach out to them to get an update on my order. SOLUTION - Work with your customer and/or provide the tracking number.
4. I reached out with a very fair email seeing what can be done. No more was offered other than ""we did our due diligence and can't be held responsible for the design, here's 10% off"". I'm asking for customer service, not an excuse to close off my inquiry. SOLUTION - Work with your customer.

For less than 20 items, it took 2 and a half weeks to ship to me, no option to pick up. I live 5 minutes away from their location. Thought it'd be great to have a supplier next door. Absolutely not, do yourself a favour and continue to support companies who emphasize the customer experience.

6902,"Over the years, we've ordered products from Tshirt Elephant, and had great experiences with the longevity and durability of the prints. Ive always been quite happy with the large selection of clotting. However, this year I've ordered a few items, and while most have been ok, the most recent purchase failed expectations. The lightweight hoodie has been washed twice(using the recommended wash temp and always inside out to reduce wash wear) and in just one month,the screen print has begun peeling off small pieces in certain areas. While I do expect standard wear (fading, cracking) of screen product, I do not expect it in one month, and certainly not peeling. I ordered one shirt earlier in the year, and have not had any of the same issue with that one, so I will chalk the new problematic one to a random bad batch. Even though I emailed the company about the issue, their claim is that it was not a significant enough issue, and is standard wear, and no replacement or refund would be issued unless it was a more significant wear issue.
Based on the previous products I would absolutely recommend T Shirt Elephant, for quality and service, but based solely on my most recent purchase and issue, I will not recommend, and will be looking locally next time for my future orders.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

The one I ordered was around $18 and the sweaters that I received were around $12.

I would ask specific questions like ""Can I have the link to the product I received"" and that would be ignored. I also brought up the specifications of the sweaters and that was ignored. I also asked if I could speak to someone of higher authority and that was also ignored.

6911,"New customers - beware of the misleading shipping/delivery times and return/cancellation policy on T Shirt Elephant's website. I've now lost $80 on a product I can no longer use. If this happens to you, based on my experience, customer service will not care. I also got the impression that they will likely not clarify these items for future customers as I'm sure the deception gets them additional sales (like myself).

On the shipping/delivery times - I see multiple reviews here saying that the delivery time on the website is misleading, yet the business has done nothing to fix it. I unfortunately didn't see these reviews before I purchased and.it caused me to order a product that I expected for 2 week delivery (it even says ""14 day delivery"" in my order confirmation), but after reaching out directly to the business I found that the product will only be printed in 14 days, then it will deliver eventually thereafter.

On the return policy - despite the return policy explicitly stating they will consider cancellations due to order error on a case by case basis, they will not. Even if their misleading advertising was the cause of said order error. Once I pointed this out to the customer service rep I was corresponding with (Chelsea), she said that actually this statement only applies to errors in design imagery. Why is that not explicitly mentioned on the website?

Overall - wouldn't recommend purchasing from them. This business doesn't care about its customers and is willing to intentionally deceive them for extra business.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6912,"I ordered 4 custom jerseys from them for $71 each and they shipped us a different jersey from what we ordered. When I called them they said they have a policy that states they can ship you ""the next closest item"" without contacting you if they couldn't get what you wanted. I had to fight them for a refund and in the end only got 50% back. You shouldn't have to call a company to confirm if they have a product that they say they have on the website.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6913,"Funny experience, ordered 4 shirts they shipped two. Took 4 weeks to complete half the order they rushed the completion to get me the other two shirts to cover their mistake. A few weeks later ordered from spreadshirt. They completed a 55 T-shirt order and they were delivered in ten days with zero rush fees. Will I order from t shirt elephant again? No, there are far better companies to order from.
I was satisfied with my order however. Hence the 3 stars, but comparatively sub par",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6914,"1. paid $177 express shipping (items never came), no one notified me either, they refunded me the shipping costs after i called.
2. took 2 days for them to tell me that they had 9/10 jerseys (one was a not for the sport i needed
3. went from Scarborough to the west to physically pick up 9 jerseys (took 30 mins to find my jerseys when i got there)
4. they placed the order for the missing jersey the same day i went to pick up the 9, i later had to come back to the west end location to pick up a single jersey (3 weeks after i was supposed to get my entire order)

Nothing wrong with the jerseys or the people that are working there but they offer 0 compensation for the headaches, not even a credit for future orders, i had to email and call to get answers. I would have appreciated something other then a ""sorry sir"" through email.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6915,"T shirts arrived one day later than tracking originally stated, however it was still earlier than expected, (before 14 days).

They are great!.Sizing looks good. Colour and printed artwork is great.

Will definitely place another order in near future!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6916,"Great products. Some items were twice as much as my usual supplier though. (American Apparel Tank Tops).Would love to be able to see where the price breaks are before designing and asking for a quote. Love that mixing colors is an option!.So easy to upload the design. Quick turnaround times too! Request for the review was poorly times, as the items were not scheduled for delivery for another week, but over all I would absolutely use them again, and I have already recommend T-Shirt Elephant to a few people! Planning our summer order now.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6917,I ordered some company logo shirts. During the order process I was emailed saying stock of my selected shirt was not available and they would offer a rotation of a similar product. I agreed. On delivery of the product I relized the rotated shirt was not of similar quality and style. If you do a basic google search you can compare the stiching and fabric weight. Obviously I didn't check that closely when they offered the rotation as I took there word for it. So now I am stuck with a bunch of low quality shirts They are 2 oz less on fabric count. Its not even a close rotation. I don't get how they can just say we reserve the right to rotate as needed. I reserve the right to not except sub par quality.But.I am expected to pay over 500.00 for this? So disapointed. I have ordered from them in the past with good results,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6918,"I am SO pleased with the professionalism and excellent experience I had with T-Shirt Elephant. I run a film production company located in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada and we just wrapped on our Feature length film ""Mercy."" As a way of thanking our crew for doing such a fine job on the film, I thought it would be nice to order them in some good quality shirts. I spent several hours calling local businesses to try and find someone who would be willing to do a quality job for a reasonable rate (one that fit into our budget). I was not successful. I therefore spent an equal amount of time searching online and came across T-Shirt Elephant. I was totally amazed how EASY it was to place my order on-line and all the wonderful options I had, plus the VERY affordable rate they offered as well. Needless to say, I received the order within the amount of time I expected it to arrive and the shirts are very good quality, durable shirts and best of all, the logo I had them place on the front of the shirt was positioned exactly as I requested and the picture they placed on the back of the shirt with the words I required was clear and positioned just as well. THANK YOU T-Shirt Elephant for your excellence!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6919,Very satisfied with the quality and service..Arrived a week early from original fulfillment date..Will order more..Thanks T-Shirt Elephant!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6920,"The good news: their shirts are beautiful and very easy to design. The bad news: they charge way too much for shipping; I know it's automatically calculated, but it seems ridiculous to charge me $12.50, then send it as lettermail for $2.95. Then, when I had an issue with the product, I simply asked if I could order another one but pay less shipping. Instead they gave me a discount of 10%, which obviously did not cover the shipping costs. I'm disappointed and going elsewhere for more reasonable prices and better service.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6921,"everything was great! a few loose threads but that's ok, they easy pulled out and on one of my hoodies, it's dark grey and the letters are black and it looked a lot more visible on the template than in person",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6922,"Buyer Beware!

There wasn't a zero rating, otherwise that's what TShirt Elephant would get from me.

I ordered online, uploaded my logo and had proof my order had the logo. When I ordered the products they appeared blank.

I immediately contacted customer service. I have in writing they were going to correct with logo and give me a price on embriodery.

Then I don't hear anything from Chelsea from customer service so I ask for an update. I get no reply. I email again and she tells me they are sending blank items with no logo.

This was the biggest Canadian shopping disappointment.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6923,"Love the shirt good quality, however customer service experience was terrible. No one would answer my questions or help me. I had a problem with shipping. Contact method wasn't the best. Order the clothing sure suggested but customer service isn't the best so you can face bad problems with that",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6924,"The size charts were WAY off, and so we sent them an email with photos proving it and they denied that that was their size chart even though it was their size chart?? So now I have custom shirts that are pretty much dresses and they wouldn't exchange or refund us at all! Definitely don't recommend using this site at all. Fix your size charts! And fix your exchange policy!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6925,"I placed an order beginning of June and received my order early-mid July. When the order came there were multiple issues with the prints on the shirts. One was poor quality printing, some had what looked like dried glue on it (that doesn't come out in the wash), and another had the logo noticeably lower than it was ordered.

I reached out to them to voice my dissatisfaction and, after a number of emails back-and-forth, they agreed to re-print the problem ones. Fast forward to September and a number emails sent (no replies) still no t-shirts. I was then informed that the employee I was originally corresponding with no longer worked for them. I was told that my shirts would be ordered and printed.

Enter November. Still no shirts. I emailed them and asked about the status. It appears as though they were never added to the ""to print"" stack and still weren't printed. They have now been printed and shipped and are scheduled to arrive next week.

I figure 2 stars is fair as the shirts that that were printed were great, but there were far too many little issues along the way to highly recommend them. I love the selection and the price, but waiting almost 6 months to get the proper shirts is too long. Will likely be taking company orders elsewhere in the future.

**UPDATE** I want to be fair in my feedback so here's an update. I got my reprinted shirts and they are exactly what I was hoping for when I originally ordered the shirts. Great quality prints on awesome shirts. All of my issues were addressed (quality, and location of prints). Hopefully others will have better luck getting what they ordered the first time.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6926,I am very pleased with the quality of the t-shirt as well as the design. I am still waiting on my second shirt from my order as something got missed with my order. However I was very happy with how easy it was to get the situation fixed and how quickly they responded back from my email. They were able to give me a couple options on how they could help to make it right. Things sometimes happen but I truly believe that it makes the world of difference on how you get treated or the follow through from company. It will either make or break whether I would order again or not. I will for sure order from them again in the future.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6927,I ordered jerseys for one of my teams (31 people) and the order came out just how I wanted. In my experience the costumer service was very helpful and would respond to my questions in less than 24 hours. The delivery came on time with all jerseys accounted for. I would defiantly order from this company again the next time I needed custom t-shirts or jerseys.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6928,"I ordered 25 t-shirts from T-Shirt Elephant and although I didn't receive all of the t-shirts I ordered, the customer service was really great, very understanding, and promptly fixed the mistake. The rest of the t-shirts came 6 days (4 business days) later after I had notified customer service. The t-shirts are good quality and I'm sure I'll be ordering from them again in the future.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6929,"Positive:
- user friendly website
- decent quality,fair prized t-shirts
So so:
- delivery time as promised, but slower than others we have used
- print quality is fine, but again not at par with another company we have used. Colors in particular are a bit dull, but overall nice.
Recommendations for improvements:
- It would be nice to separate/pack shirts individually or least organise them by color/size in the package.
I think T-Shirt elephant needs a bit of extra touch to really shine.
Hope this review is of use.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

6931,"I purchased an order of tank tops with my business logo on it a few weeks ago. When the order came in the mail, I immediately noticed that the quality was fantastic however the colours printed on the shirt were not the same as my business logo. I contacted them right away and they looked into the issue and made me a completely new batch of shirts. The shirts came in today and I couldn't be happier. Not many businesses would go above and beyond like this for their customers! I'm very happy with the level of costumer service and quality of the product. Thank you T-Shirt Elephent!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6932,"My experience so far with T-shirt Elephant has been great; packages arrive a few days earlier than estimated, the t-shirts and other items I post my design on looked great and exact, its' flexibility in how you would like to pay for your things, and the great customer service.

The only thing that's keeping it from a full 5 Stars are the spike in prices for when you put on a design onto an item, and its' lack of variety of said items in its' inventory.

Other than those, it's a great site to work with.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6933,"I was asked to leave a review before receiving the product which is a little strange so I can't review the product itself yet but I can review the service so far. The website states 14 day free shipping however I had to still pay 12.50 in shipping fees for some reason and have yet to receive anything. It has also been almost 14 business days, I live in Montreal and not too far from where the company is located and because I had to end up paying 12.50 in shipping even though the website says otherwise, it's very dissapointing to wait this long for a single shirt after paying 12.50 for shipping when it was and still is advertised as free. Really hoping the shirt ends up being worth the trouble.

Update: The shirt finally arrived on the 14th business day after ordering and I absolutely love it, great quality and was worth the wait however their customer service has been awful. All attempts to receive an answer for my problem above have been ignored and forgotten about even though the same 14 day free shipping is still on their website. Because of that, the shirt ended up costing me twice as much as it would of having ordered it from somewhere else all because I was scammed out of free shipping. The lack of care and response shows me they don't value the smaller customers as much as they do bigger companies and corporations. Good product, bad customer service. With the shipping issue my single shirt came to over 50$ and although it's nicely done, that is absurd pricing and I can get the same thing done anywhere else for cheaper all because I was charged 12.50 for 'free shipping'. Make sure the stuff you advertise works and if it dosen't, don't ignore your smaller customer complaints for weeks. Just because I'm only ordering 1 shirt now dosen't mean I won't want 100 one day and based off how much I've been shown your company cares about these kind of issues I would definitely get them done somewhere else. I need to know I can trust the company should something end up going wrong-you've had a month to reply and nothing so. ultimately a good product but uncaring customer service. I will be going somewhere else next time that advertises promotions correctly.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

6935,"T-Shirt Elephant does not stand behind their products..They take no accountability for ensuring the posted sizing charts reflect actual sizes..As a result, I received my order where sleeve length was 2.5 inches shorter than published sizing..T-Shirt Elephant's response was that they take no accountability for garment sizes. Would encourage T-Shirt Elephant to reconsider their approach to customer satisfaction and ensure a more reliable supply chain.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6936,"Got 9 basic T-shirts with 1 line of text across the chest, for around 14$ each. The website was a bit badly designed for this because you had to go back and forth from the design board to the cart to estimate total prices.
I chose the cheapest black T-shirt for this design so it is pretty poor quality in terms of thread count (that's on me). However I did expect the printed text to turn out better/more opaque. Also the printed text is crooked (as in slightly diagonal across the chest) on one T-shirt.
I received the order about 2.5 - 3 weeks after ordering (which is pretty much the time frame they said). So if you order from here, make sure you aren't on a tight deadline!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6937,"Was very excited to receive my first order until I opened it and discovered that the sizing is all wrong.

I'm please to say the logo on the front is not an iron one and it is very soft to wear.

6941,"I used T-Shirt Elephant to order jerseys for a softball tournament, and I couldn't have been more pleased with the experience.
I procrastinated and left placing the order to a point that T-Shirt Elephant's 14 day shipping guarantee would have had us receiving the jerseys on the day we left for the tournament. I was super happy to have the shirts arrive a few days early!
The quality of the shirts were beyond what we expected, the entire team was super happy with the jerseys we received. The jerseys were comfortable and we looked good at the same time!
The product we received from T-Shirt Elephant was convenient, affordable, and of great quality!

6947,"I had ordered a t-shirt as part of a campaign. I was provided with a delivery date for my t-shirt, but when it did not arrive I reached out to Customer Service via email. I was told my order was never processed due to a glitch in the system. I was told that my order was re-processed and would be shipped out ""rush"" and that I would be provided with tracking information.

I never received an email containing tracking information. I reached out once again via email regarding my order and was told that they are unable to track my order because they entered the tracking information into their system incorrectly and could not provide me with a way to track my order.

Since my re-processed order could not be found, my order was re-printed and shipped once again. I finally received my order 1 month after the expected delivery date and after several emails and phone calls with the company.

The t-shirt that I received was also printed incorrectly. The front of the shirt was the correct design, however the back of the shirt had the wrong design. I chose not to reach out to T-Shirt Elephant regarding the misprinted shirt since it took nearly a month of communication with their customer service to get the one I received.

I probably won't be ordering anything from them in the future.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6948,first order used their tshirt designer and they didnt print the backside for whatever reason i attempted to reach out but customer support blamed it on me and offered a pathetic %10 percent discount on my next order.

We placed a large order which they 1) delivered to the billing address instead of the shipping address - and claimed no responsibility. 2) some of the merchandise had incorrect printing so cannot be used and ONCE AGAIN the company has taken 0 responsibility. We were very clear that our order was the first in a series of repeat orders, and they gave us 0 responses.

Then when we had some problems they stopped responding to emails, never answered calls, etc. We're still trying to figure out why we were told an order of 4 had 3 items listed in our payout, why we're missing over $100 in payouts, and other annoyances that we simply don't get responses to. There are some clear managment issues I We'll be migrating away from this company.

Original review:

I work for a non-profit and T-Shirt Elephant has provided outstanding customer service, from the ability to choose both low cost and ethically-sourced apparel items to Rachel's incredible efforts to make our products look great and be available quickly. I've worked with various on-demand printers and drop shippers, and I can't recommend T-Shirt Elephant highly enough!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6959,Received our tshirt order today..Exceeded my expectations to say the least - the colours and print quality are great and the shirt quality and material were higher than I anticipated for the low price we paid..Delivery was more than a week earlier than order stated..I would recommend and order from here again.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6960,"Great selection of garments, excellent review process and super fast shipping. We ordered 100 shirts with front, back, and side arm printing. It was all done correctly and shipped on time. Very happy!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6961,"I had a bad experience with this company. I ordered 20 black t-shirts with a pocket size design in the front. They ship to PO Box addresses through Canada Post, so I proceeded to do that. Unfortunately Canada Post went on strike. Instead of letting me know, this company proceeded to ship my package with UPS (UPS does not ship to PO Box addresses). I had to solve the issue and pay for the change of address.

Once I received the t-shirts, the company had messed up two of the sizes. We ordered an XL and XXL t-shirts but the XL t-shirt was larger than the XXL and the XXL was the same size as a M t-shirt. Also the logo on 3 t-shirts were faded. I contacted the company, as usual they were very quick to answer and after a few email exchanges they agreed to send us back the proper size for XL and XXL but this did not come without them putting the blame on their t-shirt supplier. Which is unprofessional because T-shirt Elephant should be the one doing quality control and making sure that what they ship out is correct - this a service that they're selling.

Once they agreed to ship the two t-shirts, I requested that they send to a ‚Äònormal' address to avoid the PO Box issue and they confirmed with me that they did. A week later, my package said that it had arrived but I got no package. Fortunately we tracked down the package, and guess what, it was sent to the PO Box address before. This was too much trouble for 20 t-shirts.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6962,"Order a custom t-shirt with text and made an error in the original ordered. Then I sent an email to customer service less than an hour later, within 10 minutes I sent the email. No response. Multiple emails and calls over the next several days no response. Called the customer service line several times no one answers due to covid. But several emails later still no answer. Instead they sent the wrong order and the new corrected ordered, charged me for both and the new one looks 100 years old after one wash. Absolutely garbage company. Terrible customer service. Terrible product. Don't waste your money.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6963,"I've ordered twice from them and had a great experience both times. Shirts came in a day earlier than projected. Customer service was great both times too (Thank you Rebecca). I recommend to anyone in Canada looking for a local T shirt company, you won't be disappointed. Thanks T Shirt Elephant!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6964,"I have placed a few orders in the last couple months and all of them have come out great. They have a great online design platform that is easy to use and you can design a shirt with no experience previous.

The shirts were made and shipped out within a couple of days, and shipping took a couple days at the most within the GTA.

They claim that you will have the shirts within 14 days, but I didn't wait any longer than a week on any occasion.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6965,"Anyone up for some class-action? Terrible customer service!

Before ordering I emailed the company and explicitly told them I would not place the order if it took 14 days. In writing, they said it would only take 7 days. I received my order 2 months later! Well past the birthday I needed it for. I made a complaint and they refused to offer any kind of refund or even a discount. Then they would not let me speak to a manager and just started ignoring my emails. Can't get thru by phone. What a Mickey Mouse company.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6966,Ordered 14 t-shirts for some friends and they showed up way quicker than expected. Because of the price i was a little skeptical on the quality that I was going to receive but once I opened the package I was very impressed with the quality.

6968,"Unfortunately I have to give 1 star, the printing is amazing and done exactly the way I ask and the girl in customer service was also very nice and patient with me.

The problem is the size and the quality of the sweatshirt,.I order an XL mens because I'm 5'9 and I'm a fit person, but it fits a little tight I find and the arms are not long enough.also after wearing it only one day I started getting fluff balls all over the sweater and underneath the arms , I really hate that, when I contacted again the customer service I told them about it and the girl said that I didn't wash it properly,.it's funny because I didn't wash it I wear it the same day i got it and i never wash it yet!

Anyways i guess it's not there fault for the clothes, maybe they should change manufacture,.but the printing and the look is amazing!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

6971,"Fast service/ turn around time, and fair prices. But poor quality.
First batch did not have the correct colour/ saturation on the prints which were corrected and reshipped. The new batch has a slight size variation from the size on the print but nothing to complain about.

I've been wearing my product before the release and only after a handful of washes the print is falling apart. Contacted customer support/ management but they advised that there was no issues.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6972,"I've ordered employee uniforms from T-Shirt Elephant twice now. On both occasions, the service has been seamless from start to finish. Much more affordable than my previous supplier for good quality uniforms. Free Shipping is an added bonus! 5/5.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6973,"You email me and want me to write a review when the item hasn't even been delivered?
Sure, here goes:
I placed an order hoping it would arrive by Christmas. T-Shirt Elephant said Delivery Date of December 19. I thought: hey, that's enough buffer that it'll arrive by Christmas.
But they MEAN that THEY deliver it to Canada Post on that date. It's now December 30 at the item won't arrive until tomorrow.
If you want to be honest with your customers, it should read Estimated Shipping Date.
Who knows, maybe eventually when the item arrives it'll be worth the wait.
But seriously, how difficult is it to write Estimated Shipping Date instead?? You'll piss off fewer customers.

6974,"One might think it reasonable to assume that the method of shipping chosen by T-Shirt Elephant would have the best interests of the consumer in mind.
Based on my experience, this doesn't appear to be the case..Because they chose letter mail there is no way to track shipping..As a result, the package hasn't been delivered and their response is 'sorry, can't help you'..My suggestion then?.Don't walk away, run away from T-Shirt Elephant.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6975,"I am very pleased with the quality of the customized apron I ordered from T-Shirt Elephant..I ordered it in the first week of December, but unfortunately it was not delivered in time for Christmas and arrived on December 31st..It was for my son and so we were a little disappointed with the delay.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6976,"Poor customer relations. I had a webstore setup through them to sell my t-shirts to my clients online, which took countless hours to create, only to discover a few months ago that they took it down or closed it without informing me. When I reached out to the support staff I received no response.

Also, there were many many print issues throughout the process which has led me to believe this is an amateur company with lack of knowledge, support and quality control. Avoid.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6977,I would definitely recommend this company. My shirts looked exactly the way I designed them. I chose a style for running which was a very comfortable and light fabric. I also received it sooner than the estimated shipping date which was a really nice surprise.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V

Thanks guys.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

6983,"Very disappointed with the service. Was suppose to receive something prior to Christmas and it hasn't even been printed yet. I had lots of options and would have liked to be informed of delay. When I asked for a refund they said no as they had pulled the hoodie and just continues to say they were trying to keep safe. I get it, but again, I should have been informed that was the case prior to completing my order.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6984,"I used T-Shirt Elephant to order custom hoodies for my volleyball team..I found using their design tool fairly easy and like the pre-made templates..The price was reasonable and our orders came ahead of schedule..The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because when I was given the computer-generated quote, I wanted to confirm the price with a person so I could be certain of cost before asking athletes to purchase, and found there to be a price discrepancy..Overall though, I was pleased with the quality of service and product, and will most likely use them again.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6985,"As long as there are no issues T-Shirt Elephant offers great services. However in case you have an issue like in my case where a jersey for hockey-team was incorrectly printed; you are being sent on a wild-goose-chase, hence the two star review. Customer Service over the phone will tell you need to send an email as they can't deal with it (?you are CUSTOMER service?). These emails are getting lost apparently as miraculously two of my emails to the same address I have sent all other inquiries to didn't make it to their inbox. very strange. So here I am running out of time as I need the jersey reprinted until the end of the month (2 weeks out) and since customer service doesn't feel responsible and emails are getting answered sparingly; I have little hopes to get this issue actually resolved. Hoping T-Shirt elephant improves their grade of customer service. (learn something from e-commerce giants like walmart or amazon)
UPDATE:
changing this to a 1-star review for several reasons:
- none of the above has been rectified, same issue with an order from October 22nd has still not been resolved.
- I'm not getting any answers from customer service other than ""we'll ship it when ready"" or ""we are really busy"" (all I want is an updated shipping date)
- meanwhile I'm still getting promotional emails from t-shirt elephant, trying to increase their overall order-volume. - WHY? they are not able to truly satisfy the customers they already have and want more volume?

6987,Was really impressed with how easy the software to design the shirts was. Also they made an error with my order but when I contacted them about it they were quick to admit the mistake and send me a corrected order still in time for my event. I was very impressed with the customer service to fix my issue.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6988,Totally ordering again. Ordered two Gildan hoodies both with a large printed image on them. AMAZING quality. Fits a little small but not by much. I am generally a size small in tops but I like huge fits and so i ordered an XL which seems to me like a large so I would order a size up if you are ordering true to your own size. I live in Canada but after the order had shipped my package came within 3 days.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6989,We have ordered from T-Shirt Elephant a number of times and never have a complaint. The tanks and tees are always great quality and our event participants love them!

I let several mistakes go, but I reached my limit when my last order was missing one item and after 2 months I still haven't received a refund or the missing item, even though I followed up about it several times. On the plus side, I have been happy with the quality of items I have received. I won't be using them again.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6991,I'll start by saying that T-Shirt Elephant has the best customer service that I have come across in a long while. Special thanks to Rebecca who promptly fixed a slight design error on my last order. The quality of the t-shirts as well as the finished product are excellent. I definitely give this business the highest marks and would/will recommend them to anyone that needs any kind of.t-shirt design.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V

6993,"The website is really fun to work with.
There is also a huge selection of apparel.

This means that many of my clients will not be receiving their orders they had put in, in plenty of time!

I've never left a bad review before, and hate to leave one. but this is my second poor experience with T-shirt elephant.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
6995,"This is my second time ordering from T-shirt Elephant. The first time the product was over two weeks delayed, with no contact with the company possible as they do not answer the phone at all and rarely return emails. When I did get them to respond back, they had misplaced the order and only began production because I had kept emailing. However, my brother had a good experience with them, so I decided to try with them again. I have placed an order and am currently in the midst of once again trying to get a hold of them in regards to the submitted logo and whether the image quality is good enough for them to work with. Again, no email response, phone rings until the voicemail tells you to email them. Going to have to cancel the order directly through my credit card rather than deal with them",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

And they managed to ship way before I could even start thinking of maybe somehow become stressed ;-) We ordered 2 jackets for roughly 300$ and were worried about the print and design quality we'd get (after seeing results from other companies).

7000,"Huge waste of money and financial blow to the charity they were ordered for. Ordered large order of hats for a charity to help fundraise. First off, their website falsely advertises ""14 day free shipping"". Turns out, this does not refer to their shipping at all but production time (as told in an email from them AFTER it was too late to upgrade shipping time). So our order did not arrive on time for the event. Beyond missing out on sales at this event, the hat quality is very mediocre. Parts of the writing are completely illegible, and you can barely tell what the design is. At around $20/hat, one would expect much better quality that something that looks like it was purchased off Aliexpress for $5. I contacted the company prior to ordering on 3 separate occassions to make sure the design would turn out well, and that I would change it if it was too detailed. On all three occassions I was told it would turn out great. Contacted T-Shirt Elephant prior to writing this review, and they said they would do nothing unless threads were loose despite the hats not even being legible. Save yourself the risk and order off Aliexpress or Alibaba ‚Äì at least you won't be losing 5x the investment when the quality turns out mediocre.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7001,"T-Shirt Elephant helped my company with all the questions we had! Sade, the customer service representative that helped me with my order, was very helpful and patient with my questions.

I've never had such poor and dishonest customer service..My merchandise was shipped out but stolen before I could receive it..Canada Post confirmed to have reimbursed TShirt Elephant for the products and shipping and after a solid 6 months of communications..they have yet to reprint, reimburse or act in any way that would make their client not only happy, but actually have the products paid for in hand..I do not recommend TSHIRT Elephant.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7003,"The shirts were produced great but shipping and customer service was pretty bad. I ordered 8 different products and spent a fair amount of time and money on these designs. They told me I would receive the shirts by Dec 26 and I received them 2 weeks after that. When I talked to them, they just told me that they had a lot of orders so couldn't get to it. My opportunity to present these gifts was gone by the time I received them and I am pretty disappointed.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

They do not call you to advise you of this ""hold"". Despite this hiccup, I asked for a delivery date and my order was received well before this.

Superb customer service -- I had a few extra shirts to add the day after placing the order. I called and a representative immediately picked up, said no problem to my request, and the extra order was immediately processed. The shirts arrived nearly 2 weeks earlier than quoted and the print quality is great. Both orders arrived together in the same box and there were no errors in the quantity or type. All 30+ people who placed orders are very happy with the final product. One minor improvement they could make would be to include easy to find sizing charts on their website, but all product codes were clearly identified so it was easy to find them externally. Would definitely recommend T-Shirt Elephant to anyone ordering custom printed clothing items in the extended Golden Horseshoe.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7008,"This had the potential to be a 5-star review and me not reccomending promotique.ca over them.
I had 2 issues with my first order.
#1 As you can see in the picture I ordered Royal blue tshirts. Although they are nice shirts they are far from the royal blue pictured on the site. When I emailed to tell them they sent me replacements at no cost, awesome. When I got the replacements, they were the exact same. There response this time was ""sorry they don't look like the picture on our site but that's them."" so, problem not solved.
#2 I ordered the ""missy fit"" ladies t-shirts for ladies of my gym to workout in. Being workout shirts the last thing I wanted was a heavy shirt. I recieved the shirts and they feel like they're made of burlap, the tag says heavy cotton. The problem is that it doesn't say heavy cotton anywhere on the shirts page. I just checked again now. Their solution to this was to tell me they can't (don't want to).do reprints or refunds due to customer error.
At least the sweaters I ordered were nice.

To whoever reads this from T-shirt elephant, I would be happy to change this to a 5-star review if you at the very least reprint the ladies tshirts on something lighter.
I have spent thousands of dollars with Promotique and will have to go back them if I can't trust your website and customer service.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7009,"Hi there. I just received my order by mail today. The logo design was a bit lower than I expected. I wanted it a bit closer to the neckline. Also, for the sizes, I ordered a medium in maroon from the same The Authentic Company T-shirt Company (Ladies dry-fit style) with my school's name and volleyball logo a few years ago but was smaller than the one I got today. Perhaps it shrinks in the wash? Anyways, next time I will have to order XS and S as well as fix the positioning of the logo.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7010,"I've ordered these shirts before. The ATC baseball jerseys are great quality.
I wasn't super happy with the print this time though. The colours were faded and not the right tone.
It would be good if there was an extra proofing step before they are manufactured.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7011,"Awesome company. The site is so easy to use and customizable. Price was also the cheapest around, no other company even came close to be honest. Order arrived exactly on time. Unfortunately, one jersey had light ink stains on the front, however after emailing right away, I was offered to be sent a new one ASAP. Great customer service, definitely recommending to all.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7012,"DO NOT order from this company if you expect quality customer service. I placed an extremely large bulk order for apparel that was printed horribly, not to order, with particles visibly trapped underneath the vinyl. When I reached out to ask for help getting it fixed, I was told they would not reprint or refund my order or help in any way.

7013,"A family member has placed an order for a few hundred bucks..Ordered in mid November with estimated shipped out by Dec 4th which was supposed to be in time for Chanukah..Of course they charged her..Still waiting and it's Dec 10th. No one will answer the phone, despite the number on webpage being the way to contact them according to their website. Haven't responded to emails about timeline (after a token initial 1st email response - now they've gone dark). Won't respond to Facebook..Won't call us apparently because they are working from home during COVID (guess they are too ""busy"" to figure out how to block their number on their cell phones to call from a private number)..This reeks of being shady..If you're a big big order maybe they're fine..If you have a small order they take your money and forget about you until.well who knows?! I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt and believe that this isn't a total scam. I'd like to believe that, as I scramble to find an alternate Chanukah gift for my soon-to-be dissapointed 6 year old..We chose them because they are local..Big mistake..Better to choose someone reputable.

I guess their other reviewers, most with conveniently one or 2 or few other Google reviews, think otherwise..Shady. One person wrote about buying their ""entire T shirt collection"" from them..For that person's single only review..Oh yeah, that sounds legit, esp for a custom printing shop. I mean, who doesn't buy all their T shirts as custom prints, right!?!?!.Beware of these guys.

I went ahead and placed a single order on December 3rd and Today is December 30th and I have still received nothing. An email was sent out on the 19th saying it would arrive in 2-4 business days, and I'm still sitting here waiting.

Jason was very helpful and responsive to the design we wanted. The prints on the shirts were high quality and items were shipped within a few days. Definitely highly recommended.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7016,"Do not order from this company. My entire order of shirts were missing their designs. After multiple attempts, customer service was sporadic on their responses, and relatively slow. They claim that they are ""Canada's leading source for custom apparel"", but based on my current experience, this doesn't seem entirely truthful.

I was eventually able to get into contact with customer service, and after shipping the original misprinted shirts back to the company, the issue was mostly resolved. The ""corrected"" shirts were still not a direct match to the order.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7017,"A thoroughly positive experience, from the design and ordering process right through to delivery. The website was intuitive to use for uploading a personalized design, and there is a very good choice of good-quality products. Customer service responded quickly and efficiently to questions, and I was really pleased with the end product when it arrived.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7018,"I decided to give t-shirt elephant a try for printing company logo t-shirts..The prices were reasonable and you can buy small quantities..The two stars were given because when the pre-paid order arrived, they didn't ship most of the order..When I checked our account on their website, they had closed out the order indicating it was complete.
The bottom line is they didn't notice they hadn't completed my order and when I contacted them to fix it, they were extremely casual about the mistake and fixing it.
Lastly, I tried calling to get some information prior to placing the order, but the person answering the phones barely cares and sure didn't try to make it easier to do business. Still waiting for the forgotten portion of the order but the shirts that did arrive are fine.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7019,"I have ordered several times through this site (I think 6 times all together) and have noticed a substantial decrease in quality in my last couple of orders..My most recent order, a set of black sweaters with white and pink lettering for my rugby team was a huge disappointment. The ink used to screen the lettering on is translucent so instead of white and bright pink the letters are grey and sad pink. There was clearly no quality check before printing them or sending them out because you only need to glance at it to see they look like trash. I was offered no assistance by T-shirt elephant to remedy the situation as it is not a printing error ( they don't cover poor quality I guess).
I won't order from this company again and I will be contacting my friends to retract any previous recommendations I might have made. So much for supporting canadian businesses. Very disappointing.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7023,"How is T-Shirt Elephant still running as a business? I ordered 2 sweaters with a very simple logo. It was literally just a word with a black border around the font. I'm not a graphic designer so when I put the logo on the hoodie in the design, I zoomed in and saw that there were white pixels outside of the black font. I emailed their customer service to ask them to make sure that the white pixels be removed, as well as the space in the letter O of the logo to be empty, so that the colour of the hoodie is visible in that space. I was vaguely assured that ""their designers will review the design before it goes into production"" So I agreed and thought since this is a professional business, they know what they're doing. Low and behold, after receiving the order, the logo is exactly what I didn't want. The space in the O still has a background, and there are pixels around the black font. The font of the logo was supposed to be white but its a grey distressed shade of white. Clearly, their ""designers"" didn't review anything and just printed the logo as is in an off-white font.

I emailed customer customer service with their reply about the designers checking the product before production and was told the order falls within our acceptable print guidelines and there will be no refund or reprints. Even though they advised me that they would review the design to make sure my requests were fulfilled. There were no emails sent to me asking if it was ok to print, or that they weren't able to remove the pixels.

Lesson learned - don't have faith in a 'company' with so many bad reviews. You would think giving a company your business and money would warrant some kind of respect during a pandemic but they don't care at all. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7024,"T-Shirt Elephant used to be my go-to for printing shirts and sweaters, but has since gone downhill. by a landslide.

I first ordered from them a few times, printing my own designs on t-shirts and hoodies. I appreciated their wide selection of products and the quality of printing was quite good, even after multiple washes. As others have stated, shipping times are a little misleading but it never bothered me too much at the time since I was not on a deadline and/or would order early enough that it would still get to be on time despite delays. It was odd as some orders would arrive REALLY early, or quite late. There wasn't much consistency in this department.

What really got to me was when I started a webstore with them - at first, things were going great as the staff took their time to explain how this would work, answered all questions, and communication was open at all times. However, after partnering for some time and with some changes in their staffing, orders for clients were getting misprinted so I had to personally reorder it for them for reprints (time-consuming and annoying), and eventually, the person who was on their end just stopped replying emails completely. I literally have been chasing them for my commissions from Aug and Sept of 2019, which are STILL NOT PAID TO ME. RIDICULOUS. The last email they sent me was to say that they are changing structure and how the webstores work, and that they'll ""update all the webstore owners"" which is a lie as this was said at the end of 2019 and I have still not heard from them. Ultimately, closed my shop because I did not want anyone else purchasing my designs and them have more commissions being owed to me. At this point, it looks like I'm never going to get paid for those products with MY design and they've just pocketed all the money.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7025,"I created apparel for our academic program. Website wouldn't process if billing and shipping is different. Customer service had asked me to send shipping address by email. They sent it to the billing address anyways and told me that they can't do anything about it because there is no guarantee that the address change would happen. We are a team of students who had to move a 32lbs package across Montreal.
Customized names were printed at a different location as we requested through the website and we have asked about it in previous emails. We had a print on the back which is the default place for the names.

7027,"Brutal, brutal, and brutal. Is the only word to describe this companies operations and the customer service they pretend to offer.

This is the first time as a business owner that I have ever considered writing a review and on that note congrats to T-shirt-elephant.

From the first step of trying to redeem a 20% code that was guaranteed on all future orders ( on a combined order two years prior between family members) to the last on receiving sweaters that fit two sizes less then what they were supposed to fit has made this painful. To make matters worse it takes 3-4 days to get a response over email.

When contacted about the sweaters being to small I was presented with a Gildan measuring chart and ask to send in pictures with a tape measure. I have done this twice and it clearly doesn't Match the measurements on the chart. I am asking for the XXL's ( only 6 of them) to be replaced with the actually size sweaters and the rest of the $1200 order I will live with. I am now receiving no response and will be leaving this review up until my order has been resolved.

Do your self a favour and avoid unnecessary headaches by finding a different distributor with a solid review base unlike this one.

First off, the shirt quality is amazing. I was expecting much flimsier t shirts. Second, the printing looks great. Everything was exactly as specified, and the shirts were at the door in like a week (tbf, I live within a couple hours of the location they were coming from, but still.)

Incredibly happy, and pricing for the size of the order was significantly lower than what we had been quoted from other printers. I will definitely be coming back for future clothing printing needs. I can't comment on customer service because we didn't have to use it.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7031,I ordered 3 black shirts and 2 white shirts..I provided the same resolution design for all the shirts only the only the designs were two different colours..One for the black shirts and one for the white shirts..I have to say that while the white shirts looked really good the quality of the image on the black shirts where terrible and at $30 per shirt I would expect better quality..I don't think I would attempt another order and it's sad because otherwise my shopping experience was good aside from the end result of the black shirts.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7032,"I've ordered from T-Shirt Elephant a couple of times and I've been really happy with everything. I had one shirt come in that was not the same as how it looked online so they're sending replacements with another base t-shirt, nice customer service. I would recommend them.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7033,"We ordered sweats for our company and we couldn't happier!.The quality of the shirts and printing was exactly what we ordered..The only downside is the delivery.please, please consider using a courier..Canada Post's online tracking is not accurate.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7036,"The system to creating your our custom shirt is fast and easy..I LOVE THE OPTION OF DOWN LOADING YOUR OWN ART CLIP ART WORK. THE BEST IS YOU HAVE AN OPTION TO REMOVE WHITE BACK GROUND ON THE ART WORK. I don't think this option is on many other custom t-shirts websites..Plus love the option that I can create my design and then I can use it on more then one type of item - shirt, hoodie etc.. it simply switches for you so you don't have to start from the being. 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!.I created 12 shirts for our family Christmas gathering. from kids XS to adult XXL. all with same design!

7038,"T-shirts were great; unfortunately as soon as I submitted by order I realized I made a mistake with my size distribution list. I emailed the company immediately to try to fix it and they responded a number of days later (after 2 follow up emails from my end) basically saying I was SOL. ""We do not amend orders after they are placed."" Would have appreciated at least a little flexibility. Human error happens.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7039,"I am very happy with the product! I had t-shirts printed for a rec soccer team!
great colour choice and we used a soccer print T-shirt Elephant had! It was perfect.

Highly recommend!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7040,"T shirt elephant is great! òç I had my worries about how the quality would be on the prints for each shirt and the sweater I ordered. It looks as if I bought it out of a store. Looks amazing. I haven't washed the shirts or sweater yet. So I'm worried they may shrink or the picture may come off slightly but reading others reviews, it all seems pretty good! I'll definitely order again. Already have custom shirts sitting in my cart that I've created. Might be going a little crazy now with the designs ôÑòÅòú sooo excited to get more!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7041,"Very poor service, my orders were
never completed because they kept on forgetting things. I first emailed because I had only initially received half of my items. After emailing, I eventually received another package of what I thought was the rest but was unpleasantly surprised to see they had still forgotten part of my order. I emailed a second time and requested the rest of the order but it still has not come.a month has passed since I ordered the items. I did not receive any compensation for their order mistakes, I was just met with an offer of a 10% discount on my next purchase. Unfortunately, I will no longer be doing business with them and they have lost me as a customer. I was very displeased with their lack of service and organization.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7042,"Very pleased with my first shipment. Product turned out great. Only issue I had was shipping as the carrier said I would have it by a specific date after it had originally been shipped. I ended up receiving the product about 14 days after original.shipping date which was the intended shipping length.

Overall happy, and will be back.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7043,"Awesome and easy to use design platform. Ordered the t-shirts for a bachelor party with a pretty tight deadline and I was reassured that everything would be ready in time. Rebecca Mattina, the customer service rep, was amazing at ensuring that the order would be pushed along and get to us on time. Her communication with us was amazing and definitely was a huge reason this review is 5 star. Would order again!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7044,The product I received looked just like I wanted it too and was produced very nicely. The article of clothing didn't look cheesy and was comfortable. There was also no difficulty in the ordering/delivery process. Will definitely be ordering from here again.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7045,"Ordered items for a team party, but needed a few days earlier than the scheduled shipping date. Customer Service team was able to help deliver the order earlier. Much appreciated. Quality items and tool to customize was easy to use. Great experience.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7046,"Great Experience!.I was in a bit of a rush to get some T-Shirts for a stag I was organizing and Sade from T-shirt Elephant really came through for me..When I ordered, the expected delivery date was three days after the event I was organizing..I called up T-shirt elephant and got Sade in customer service on the other end..She really helped me out and got my order to me just before my event without paying the extra $200 in shipping..The shirts were a hit..All the sizing fit as expected and the quality was top notch..After shopping around online I found T-Shirt Elephant was one of the cheapest and easiest to use..The design tool was also very simple anyone could use it.

One thing I might recommend in the design tool and this is really grasping at straws here is to make it so within a single text box you can have multiple colors..As of right now each text box must have only one color designated to it..For example if you have a three word sentence on the back of the shirt and you want to use three different colors you would have to create three text boxes and line them up manually..I still managed to make it work even with this limitation it just ended up taking more time, but the shirts still came out great.

Thanks Sade and thanks to the staff of T-Shirt Elephant, you guys rock!.I have already recommended your company to friends.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7047,I looked at quite a few online shirt stores before I selected Shirt Elephant..Price was what drew me to order from them..They have the.best prices online that I could find by quite a margin..Once I made my order using their fairly simple design tool my order was shipped in a day or two and arrived 4 days before their estimated date..Using this company was a great experience and I would recommend to anyone.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7051,"I think the jerseys are pretty decent quality but had a little bit of troubles with the customer service. There was a mistake on my order that the system did not recognize the number ""0"" for one of the jerseys, so the jersey showed up as having no number. I had emailed them about this, and after a few days I got a response from one of the girls saying she would look into this and get back to me. Anyways - never got a response and when I received the jerseys the issue wasn't addressed at all. Would have just been nice to know rather than find out on the spot when I already had the jerseys. Also I had put as a note on my order a concern and I never got a response about any of those concerns. Overall, shipping and sizing of jerseys were good but customer service could have used a little more work.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7052,"I didn't feel like a valued customer at all,.it took them 52 days to ship my order. And I got no reason as to why it took that long. All in all, I wouldn't recommend t-shirt elephant for your company's merch
They do decent customer service. But there's always room for improvement",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7053,"I like the lay out of the website, it is stream lined and easy to use. I was having issues in chrome browser so had to use firefox.

I picked out a more expensive shirt, it was soft and fit to size, unfortunately the seam started unraveling after first day of wear. In the end it was a waste of money so that really made me sad that the quality wasn't there even when I invested money into it. That may not be the companys fault and was more the brands fault. but perhaps the quality control just isn't there.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7054,"Placed an order for T-Shirts, only to pick them up and see that the designs were cropped from my original uploaded PDF and one of the designs were flipped backwards! I was surprised because the design studio had the right design, but the checkout picture had a slightly cropped version of that. If you're ordering from here be wary that the design studio may crop your design. After a rally of emails with Rebecca, she was nice enough to give me a 20% off the next order and correct the flipped jersey to the correct design (Hence the 2 stars), but I still needed to reorder all the other shirts because I desperately needed the shirts. I am disappointed and poor.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7055,"The quality of the first order was great, but graphic
placement was a bit sloppy. I placed a second order including instructions and the delivery was perfect. Customer service is robotic, with templated replies, but they are efficient and that made me happy too. Definitely will use again.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7056,Excellent quality of fabric in the tee shirts I ordered. There was some shrinkage in some of them but I wash I. Warm water and use a dryer. No pilling and they hold their shape. No issues with ordering on line and receiving my order..I haven't found better quality or price anywhere else.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7058,i'm so happy with my sweatshirt ! it was a bit of a one off thing and i wasn't sure what to expect but it came quickly and exactly the way i designed it. i only read the reviews after and was a bit skeptical but i couldn't suggest ordering from here anymore.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7059,"Customer service was good to deal with. Helped out with my needs right away. Shirts themselves we also good. Prints turned out really well.

Had a small issue with the color of the prints and they were accommodating",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7060,"Don't bother using them if you're buying a few shirts.

The order manager has no sense of customer service to try and move up your order with sufficient lead time. They are always 'over whelmed with orders' or 'busier than usual' whether you follow up one day, one week or one month after. Expected arrival within 14 business days and it's been over a month and missed gifting this item on time.

I'm still waiting for my order, and am seriously wondering if they even shipped it via Canada Post.

Take your business elsewhere and avoid the headache.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7061,"One of my hoodies came without a logo, but customer service was quick to respond and refund me for the missed logo. So, overall, my experience with T-Shirt Elephant was positive.

I'm not sure I find the actual quality of the hoodies to be worthwhile, though. Personally, I thought I paid plenty for the hoodie + print, but the quality of the hoodie I got here is probably one of the worst hoodies I own. It's already getting fluff, even though I've only worn it a couple times. And the cuffs are too scratchy to wear without a long sleeve underneath.

While I'm very appreciative of receiving quality service, receiving quality products seems a bit more than my price point.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7064,"I ordered 2 sweaters for nearly $100. They shipped the items to the wrong person and I got someone elses. I returned the other persons with the shipping label they provided but I never got mine. It is nearly impossible to reach them right now because their ""office is closed due to Covid-19"" even though customer service emails can be answered remotely. They never followed up to make sure we recieved our items after THEIR mistake. So I am out money and have no product. It has been months. The sweaters were a gift and now obviously they are very very late. Useless customer service.

7065,"This was our 1st order from T-Shirt Elephant..On November 21, 2019, we placed an electronic order from Victoria BC for 4 white aprons with recipes printed on them..We searched a couple of places, but T-Shirt Elephant was one of the best prices for what we wanted, which was actual printing on an apron (not a sticker, or any kind of stick on product)..First we filled out the form to see what the final cost, including shipping was..Once we determined.we were OK with that, we decided to place the order..The online ordering was pretty good for someone who has never done it before..We had multiple color options and we had to provide our artwork for printing..We were advised our order would be delivered by December 11th, but it showed up 1 week early on December 4th..The quality of the apron was very good..The printing of the recipes was about as good as it could be, as our artwork could have been a little better (very old hand printed recipes scanned at 600dpi to a pdf file)..We were very pleased with the entire final product and the process..If we ever need something printed again (as Arnold Schwarzenegger would say), I'll be back!.Thank you very much.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7071,Just got my 2nd order of custom Tees from them the design which I modified from the 1st order turned out perfect this time 1st order I located it a little too low my fault entirely. Their design program works well has a few glitches like any software but once you get familiar with it it works. I also like that you can save your designs for future. T shirt quality is good and great price if you order 12 or more.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7075,"I was super excited to find an incredible + affordable apparel printing company within Canada! I needed to get some custom shirts made for an upcoming event that I am hosting. I placed my order on March 7, 2016 so that they could arrive with plenty of time prior to my event on April 7, 2016.

As of today, March 31st, my shirts have still not arrived. I'm in Calgary, and my shirts were said to arrive within 2-3 days after they were shipped out on March 14th. After calling into customer service, I was told that since the packages are shipped out as letter mail that no one would even be able to find the missing parcel. I was told to contact Canada Post to see if they could help me.

I leave for 5 days for my event where I was hoping to have had these shirts for, and I'm super disappointed that I'll now not have any customized apparel seeing as mine are lost somewhere between Toronto and Calgary.

I absolutely love supporting and being able to support Canadian companies, but it's just such a bummer when this happens, and the customer service doesn't do anything to resolve the problem.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7076,"Well, it's convenient enough but they could use some lessons from Amazon on communications. Immediately after submitting my order and shirt logo, I noticed a mistake in the logo. I immediately called and went to voicemail. Next call, 2 minutes later I got through to someone and she said to send in the corrected logo by email - which I immediately did. The order was processed faster than my expectations and shipped several days earlier than promised. But, they used the wrong logo.

7080,"My experience with this company was great. If you tell them exactly what you want, they will ensure to follow suit. My tshirts came out great and what I love the most is that you don't need to place a minimum order unlike other companies. The customer service was also amazing.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7081,"When the scheduled delivery date came and went I followed up, they said they would look into it. 5 days later I had heard nothing, so I followed up again, they said they had lost one of the items that I ordered.

I can't use them again, there are other companies offering similar services who deliver on their commitments. 2 stars because the item that I eventually received was quite good.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

Ordered nearly $1000 in sweaters (crewnecks, hoodies, zip-ups) from this company and the first estimate they sent had the complete wrong numbers, colours, and sizes so I corrected them and they made the changes only for us to receive the order one week after the expected date because the embroidery machine was down because the company was moving locations. Finally received the order and it was all good except one product I ordered was not sent at all and when emailing the company they have yet to respond to my request for them to send it. Truly suggest ordering directly from a larger and more well established company‚Äì‚Äìpersonally will not use their company again.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7084,"Loved the shirts we ordered - they were exactly what we were wanting. :)

We also received them within the timeframe given, which was great.

The only thing that would have made it better was more colour options. We ordered the baseball Ts, but only had the option for a white body (with a choice of colour for sleeves). We'd ideally liked to have had black or grey-bodied Ts with contrasting coloured sleeves. If this is something you could incorporate in the future, that would be wonderful!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

When I asked about it I was told that it didn't fit the specs set out on the website. This is fair, but why not tell me that, instead of sending a product that has a changed design.

I wish I read the reviews before I ordered from them..The order page says 14 business days, but when you actually get a confirmation email it is actually 14 business days for them to ship out your order, then they can blame it on any body. Do NOT order from them if you need your order in less then 3 weeks time without paying for the extra rush..I am sitting in regret right now, and not sure what I should do, as my order will most likely not arrive by the time I need them..A very Costly and embarrassing mistake.

I was so impressed with how quick they were, plus the quality is excellent and exactly what we wanted for soccer (comfortable & light weight) The print turned out better than I had expected so I will definitely recommend T-Shirt Elephant to anyone and use them again in the future!

7098,"Very unhappy with their professionalism and customer service. I had put in an order and approximately two weeks later on Thursday, February 27, they emailed me saying my order was ready for pick up. I went to their location on Friday, February 28 at 2:30pm (still within their operating hours) only to find that their receiving/shipping door was locked and there was no one in the visitors office (front door was also locked). I waited about 30 minutes, hoping maybe someone was on break and would return. At about 3:00pm, there was still no one so I sent them a detailed email expressing my frustration with the process. I also tried calling the number they provided multiple times and there was no reply on the other end. On Monday, March 2, I decided to call them before I drove there to make sure they were actually open when they said they were. Again, no answer on the phone line (I called twice, with about 30 minutes in between each call). I decided to go there anyway since it was on my way home, and thankfully I was able to pick up my order this time. I received an email after picking up my order saying that they were closed on the Friday because of a work event. Totally understandable, but it would have been nice if there was some sort of notice or warning that they would be closed on Friday. Even an automated recording on the voicemail stating that they'd be closed on Friday, February 28 would have been nice but as I called, their voicemail was still dated back to the holidays in December.making me a bit more skeptical about this company. I received no form of accomodation for my troubles and they clearly don't seem to care about customer relations.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7102,"A joke of a business. Ordered 45 sweaters from these guys, they forgot to make an entire size. That was 21 sweaters out of the total 45. I drove down to their office to sort it out since they never answered the phone, they made me wait 1 hour while they searched. These were supposed to be gifts and were quite time sensitive (Christmas around the corner). The woman then told me that they would refund the entire order since they had nearly forgot half my order. I was disappointed but agreed. I went out and found someone that could do the job for the remaining 21, but had to charge more since I needed it the same day. I figured I wouldn't be in such bad shape financially since T-Shirt Elephant agreed to refund my order. A couple days later I received an e-mail from T-Shirt Elephant that all they could refund was the sweaters I didn't get.

They couldn't stop talking about how nice the shirts were during our first game wearing them, yesterday :) We ordered shirts from T-Shirt Elephant after price comparing at many other websites - we found their prices the most reasonable and loved the idea of supporting a Canadian company.
The shirts are excellent quality - even better than we were expecting - and they look great! Value is high, the website is intuitive, and we are all happy campers. Thanks TShirt Elephant!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7104,"I was very pleased with the service I received from T-Shirt Elephant. I custom made a shirt for my boyfriend's birthday, and it arrived within a week and was of excellent quality; the colors were very vivid and the finished product looked just like the preview of the shirt I had seen after I finished designing it. It is one of the cheapest websites I've found for custom clothing. I would highly recommend it!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7105,"Always great service, good communication throughout the entire process..The lead times are very reasonable, they turn around orders quickly..Fast, reliable and good quality products..A great company to deal with.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7106,"Ordered 2 t-shirts from them. They are super soft and the print is great quality. The e-mail said I would get them in 2 weeks and I got them in 4 days instead. Great service, will buy from again.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7107,The shirts are high quality and they look great. I have had some trouble in the past with how quickly the orders are completed but the last couple times have been perfect. I will use this company again!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7108,"Update 2019-07-09
Following my 2* review, I finally reached customer service and they fixed the situation about the missing shirt. Despite the delay, they deserve at least 4*, for they have the best website to customize your image and shirt I've experienced so far, and they offer a fast delivery. And please, don't try to explain why you didn't notice my first email. Just tell me that this situation has allowed you to identify an important issue in your customer experience and that I've given you the opportunity to fix it. Still, I received a very polite response.
--------------------
I'm overall satifisfied with the ease of use of the website and the fast delivery. However, I tried twice to comunicate with them, including once about a missing shirt, and I didn't get any response from them. Fortunately, we ordered extra shirts and didn't absolutly need it, but we paid for it!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7109,"Got the email.to review before receiving the product. Understandably at this time that there are mail delays, however the website does not indicate shortage of staff, and processing delays. So far, not impressed with this company. Will revisit once the product is actually received in the mail.

Placed a second order. 2 months later never received. Keep using mail delays due to ongoing COVID circumstances. Revise to deal with the issue at hand, that the order is lost and they will not refund money. Thieves!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7110,"T-Shirt Elephant is my go to online store for getting customized shirts in a jiffy! The user interface was extremely intuitive and when I had to make a last minute change to my order, their customer service rep was friendly and helpful and got me the updates I needed. I would recommend these guys to anyone who likes A+ quality with A+ service and reliability.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7111,Such a sweet and easy spot to order a T-shirt printing quickly! Really easy to explain what needs to get done & phenomenal customer service. I'll be using them again for sure,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7112,"Very impressed with T-Shirt Elephant for their quality, t-shirt selections, fast turnaround,.price and most of all service. I placed my order on Dec 4th but I made an error online with my shirt selections. I called in and spoke with Sade who quickly and easily made the corrections and the order was shipped out on Dec 9th. I have already recommended them to friends and will be ordering more shirts from them in the future. No minimum order too!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7113,This is our second year using T-Shirt Elephant for our convention..The quality has been spot on both years and the price is excellent..The one issue that we did have (A wayward fingerprint on one of the shirts in the ink) was quickly fixed with a replacement tshirt..Will certainly be ordering again next year!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7114,"The quality of the shirt is fantastic, although the logo press wasn't the greatest. One of the three shirts had a smudge in the logo. A bit disappointing from a QC prospective. The time to fulfill the order was extensive as well, but to be expected during a pandemic.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7115,My order was taking longer than expected but my concern was attended to promptly by customer service in a professional manner. I love the products! Got 4 hoodies. They're very well made and I will be ordering again!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7116,"The guys are cracking me up . I don't think they ever heard of customer service in their life . first I ordered T-shirts that were not clearly labeled as youth however they are youth size. as soon as I realized their system mislabelled the T-shirt type, I contacted support via email. So no reply. After a day I called them on their phone line which is included in the order email and phone got dropped twice. Then next day I left 2 voice messages, and been calling about 9 times in the last week about updating the order.

Finally Friday I was able to get a hold of the ""customer support"", and the woman told me that apparently even though they have orders email thats listed you can't reply to that email even though you have to email with a ""new email"", and system automatically closes it otherwise. Also their phone number does not work properly for receiving voice messages, also the line where it says:

(up to 14 business days)
Est Delivery Thursday, July 4, 2019
(Note: This date refers to the shipping date. Final delivery will depend on the shipping location)

right below it saying the date about which is delivery date apparently is just a shipping date which is counter intuitive and just confusing .

And the reason for that apparently is their system does not allow to change it, so they themselves don't know how to update these messages.

So finally after week they said that manager will call me back .

So in short:

* Very very bad customer support you can't even call it customer support
* No replies to voice mail and 2 emails send 1 hour after order was placed
* Confusing and incorrect statements in order emails
* Misuse of labels on their products for shirt sizes
* No proper ticketing system for handling customer support requests
* Always busy and queued up with customer print requests . so if you need anything on time they won't delver . I have to adjust corporate event now for 20 people because they did not deliver .

On the side note I should have ordered locally and not bothered with out of province company, would have saved a lot of nerves .

Suggestions:
1. Create a *proper* ticketing system, its time to move on from the 90s for using email as communication like Jira or ZenDesk or whatever .
2. Please put someone to call or reply to customer feedback *don't ignore your customers, and say that you are too busy to pick up a phone
3. Focus on improvements and not fake reviews on Google to counter all the bad Local reviews .",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

It took more than a month to get that ONE sweater and they were gonna send the right one but with faster shipping which was like 2 weeks. So I get the second sweater and they messed it up AGAIN! There customer service was slow and not professional! I had to wait another 2 weeks for the THIRD sweater and finally they got it right and I asked for a refund which the agreed to giving it to me and I have not received a penny back from them! I asked why I haven't gotten it yet and they claimed that I needed to talk to my bank about that???? Really unprofessional and disorganized!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V

I accidentally clicked the hold for pickup button and they realized the mistake and ship me more t-shirts anyway the only concern I had was the price was a little high.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V

Package arrived exactly on the date promised, so I was able to coordinate picture taking for Christmas. Will gladly use again. Good job!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7130,Very happy with the quality of the product- looked just like the pics. My only complaint would be that I needed to start another whole order for an additional shirt which meant another shipping charge even tho I had only placed it a day beforehand. Otherwise great company.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V

I was suspicious because the price was so good, but T-Shirt Elephant has a physical location in the GTA, and the shirts are authentic AA.

Unfortunately can't comment on the screen printing services, but I'm 100% ordering blanks from here again.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7135,"Don't expect much from this company. The quality of the hoodie materials is decent but the printing is horrible.

Will not use the site again.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7136,"Ordered a bunch of shirts, and they look great. I was concerned about the screen printing because my design had many colours in it, however it turned out great.

Now, it's just went downhill. Almost 2 months to receive my order, service were non-existant, quality was okay.

I was litteraly stuck with them: on one hand, they were having delays and order was not processed yet; on the other hand, they didn't want to refund anything and cancel the order.

7142,"Incredibly disappointing. After browsing for awhile and being directed to this site, I was somewhat excited that I could customize the merchandise. Did just that and ordered a few weeks before I was to go on tour. I even laid down the extra $100 to have it expedited. Now I'm on tour, no t-shirts. Called them 3 times and whoever ""Chris"" is, never answers his phone. Pretty sure I'll never use this company again and look for something in Montreal instead. I'm so frustrated it's taking a lot of willpower not to drop F bombs in this review. Elephant indeed. More like an elephant in the room. Terrible.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

I called customer service to inquire if I had any options and she kept insisting that I follow the size chart provided even though there wasn't one provided.

7160,"I made an order about a month ago for 80 mixed youth and adult t-shirts with T-Shirt Elephant, with two different screen sizes. In our invoice, it was agreed that we would get 2 different screen sizes and they even drafted a mock-up for us of the two sizes. However, when we received it approximately 2 weeks ago on August 10th, I opened the box to find that all the screen sizes were the same. I have left at least 4 voicemails and numerous emails to T-Shirt Elephant asking them to acknowledge the mistake and make amendments, but it has been 2 weeks since the first attempt at contacting them and I have yet to receive any reply (August 28th). We ended up being forced to start our event with the wrongly sized t-shirts and are very unhappy that not only was there a mistake, but also because we feel like we have been ignored for the past two weeks from the seller. At least a third of our t-shirts were made with the wrong screen size. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM. They were nice at first but they made a mistake and they are NOT owning up to it and are flat out ignoring me.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7164,"Good print quality on the shirts. Great customer service and they respond within minutes of an inquiry. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the actual t-shirt quality.

Overall:
Great product and great prices. But they need to work on their communication with their customers and inner workforce.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7166,On the day I ordered the shirt I also ordered a shirt from China. I received the shirt from China with free shipping a week before the one from T-shirt elephant which charged 12.99 to ship from the country I live in. I understand the shirt was probably made to order but when it was finally shipped it still took a week to arrive which is unacceptable when you are charged that much to ship a t-shirt. I suspect this tactic is used to make the shirts look cheaper than they are.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7189,"Tshirt was good quality, material is nice and soft. The only reason it's not 5 star is that it takes a bit of time to deliver, however, it did arrive a few days before the estimated delivery date, which was great.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7190,"Not trustworthy, would not pay commission back to not for profit registered charity Teddy's Outreach Foundation. Initially provided excuses for months of delays until finally stopped responding. Perhaps they are crooked or sloppy, either way they should be avoided at all costs.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7191,"Ordered two women's medium sport shirts. The actual printing is fine, but the shirts were massive. The sleeves went down to my elbows (and I'm usually a large). We are swimming in them. Not at all what is pictured on the site. Waste of money.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7192,"Bought the ATC‚Ñ¢ EUROSPUN¬Æ RING SPUN TEE and I'm happy overall. However, the negative: it seemed like the logo I desired on my shirts was centered on the website. however, when they came in they were quite a bit off. A little frustrating but not the end of the world. Again overall happy with the quality/print of the shirts!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7193,T-Shirt Elephant was the perfect way to design some hoodies to celebrate good memories of our challenge as a family to swim in all 5 Great Lakes this summer. We liked the fact that there was no minimum and the kids had fun designing the hoodies online. They did a good job and the order came sooner than expected. We will use their services again in the future and tell others about them.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7194,Online ordering was super easy. Great quality of products. Delivery came 2 weeks early. I am a very satisfied customer and will be ordering from T-Shirt Elephant again!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7196,"Well worth the price..Great quality sweatshirt and the decal was better than I had expected!
The site is very easy to use..Love that you can upload your own pictures and that there's the option for creating single items.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7197,"I ordered a custom hoodie as a gift. It came better than I ever expected..The decals on the front and back are great (on the front I asked for the faded or worn look)..I got standard shipping (was a tad pricey but Canada Post so.) it came a week early which was just what I needed! Right on time for the bday..I choose the Men's ""Fruit of the Loom"" hoodie in Small and its a great fit for a female that wears Medium..I feel the Men's selection for hoodies is better than the Ladies and that's the only reason my rating isn't a 5.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7198,Received a printed apron as a gift from T-Shirt Elephant and it was perfect! Love this product from a Canadian company. The site was user friendly with so many options! Will use this again for future gifts and prints :),T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7199,"If I could give this zero stars, I would. I was hugely dissatisfied with my custom T-shirt order. I had ordered for my son for a Halloween costume because he has sensory issues and can't wear a typical costume. I gave it at quick rinse and the artwork faded so badly you can barely see it. Huge waste of time, money. and we have no Halloween costume now. :(",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7200,"T-shirt and graphic turned out great :).Received as expected, with only a minor delay due to COVID-19 measurements in place..Not the first time I've shopped T-Shirt Elephant & I'm sure it won't be the last..Would definitely recommend.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7201,After I placed the order I realized I was entitled too a first time customer 10% discount..I immediately called but they refused to give me that discount retroactively..Now they are asking for a positive review!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7202,My order was for just one single T-shirt as a test run. The shirt and printing quality were both fine however the 3 week delivery time was terrible. Sorry.won't be a Return Customer.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7203,Very disappointed they don't seem to care much to have good customer service. Hard to get a hold of on the phone or via email. First time ordering and 60% of my order was printed incorrectly i notified them they credit me 15% and re issued the items almost two weeks later after countless calls and emails only to be told they are very busy. I was made to feel because my order was small compared to the large daily orders I was ignored. When I received the reprints this week there is still issues. Not impressed.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7204,Great speedy service! I've ordered from these guys twice already and got my shirts faster than I thought I would. They look exactly like how they were designed online. Would definitely order with them again,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7205,Very good quality as usual! My only concern is the colors were not exactly the same as my photo (the orange turned more red than orange) but overall I'm satisfied ‚úåÔ∏è,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7206,"Okay experience. I needed shirts printed for a KS fulfillment and the printing was subpar - white had leaked around the design and made it look messy and unprofessional. Disappointed by how they look, but I had to go ahead with a short deadline and will have to send these along with an apology to backers.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7207,Just received the shirts and the DTG printing quality is amazing. My order got shipped out on Wednesday and was received the very next day. So happy with how everything turned out and will definitely be ordering again.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7208,"Creating the t-shirts images was easy, plenty of choices of t-shirts, fabric, etc, to choose from, rapid delivery. My only reason for not allowing 5 stars is that the t-shirt size guide may induce error, as mine were L and I barely fit in both models, whereas normally I am a medium to large person, fitting loosely in a size L. Otherwise, great experience, will play again :)",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7209,"Shirts were exactly what I asked for. They came in half the estimated time. I was impressed with how quickly they arrived but more than anything I love the ease and simplicity of the site. I've been searching for a site like this for a while.
Only criticism is I want to order hats and other merchandise that they don't offer.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7210,"Absolutely abysmal customer service. Dealing with Chelsea was a nightmare that I don't care to revisit for another second of my life. Refused to give me a quote for my order unless I manually setup the order myself (to the point of getting to the checkout page). Upon explaining that what I was seeing seemed wrong, I was again informed that I could only get a quote through the page. I'm trying to get t-shirts for my business (staff, as well as for resale) so trying to plug in 50+ t-shirts/etc into the system just to get a quote is a brutal thing to tell potential customers to do.

Will not do business with this company. I don't like talking to a wall and having someone absolutely disregard everything I'm saying to them. I strongly suggest the same of you.

Edit: I asked a few times for a quote from your people. You were given a list of specifics, sizes, and I even offered to make the design in your design tool. You refused to help me and told me I had to use the online tool for a quote. I told you I was seeing discrepancies in pricing and things weren't working out for me with your tool and still you pushed me to the tool. There is no confusion here. I wasn't looking to place my order, I was looking for a general price for my order without having to spend an hour putting in each individual item.

Customer service here needs work when they don't even admit to their faults when negatively reviewed.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7211,"I printed some T's for my blog, Indie Trendsetters. My design was pretty ambitious and I was worried that they wouldn't be able to do it or the T's would end up not looking great. Turns out they did just a spectacular job, the print was clear, the online representatives were really friendly and supportive (they answered all my beginner's questions), and the T shirts arrived on time. I honestly couldn't be happier.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7212,"Refused to let me know how long my order woudl take after being several months late and then refused to cancel my order. The entire process with their customer support has been terse and snarky.

Order took several months to arrive, I wish I could review them 0 stars",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7213,"High quality Logo printing, fast e-mail response times, really good quote system that is accurate. They missed printing 4 out of my 27 hoodies but customer service responded fast and.dealt with the problem in a timely and excellent manner.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7214,"I rarely ever order things online but I've had this gift in mind for my boyfriend for a while now. I took a chance when i decided to go with T-Shirt Elephant, and I'm ecstatic to say how happy I am with my final product. I ordered a custom hoodie with a logo, and got my order within a few days, faster than I expected. THANK YOU!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7215,"BEWARE- This company has a messed up return policy as they processed my order as a blank T-SHIRT and then tried to get me to ""reorder"" with the design I requested to begin with so they can scam me twice. Customer service is rude as hell and isn't actual CUSTOMER SERVICE. New customers theres alot of other reputable companies that will value your business. Thank god I didn't process a large order. Yikes",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7218,Great experience and great product. I was searching for a company to make one custom hoodie and I absolutely love it. The website was easy to use and I received my order in a timely manner. The customer service was also very good.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7219,"This company is a scam. Submitted & paid for order, 2 months later no shirts, no updates, no emails returned, one bogus message about saying in might have been a shipping error (in the same message they also said it hadn't yet shipped) . It's a scam. I don't think this company actually makes anything, it just charges your credit card and probably sells the info. I feel badly for trying them out, please heed the other reviews here and don't ever go near them",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7220,Ordered shirts for our band and they were about 2 weeks late showing up. Opened the box and the logo is about a 1/3rd of the size that was submitted. Emailed back and forth half a dozen times and was basically told too bad and thanks for your money. We Have dealt with tshirt companies before and never have had this arrogance from the so called customer support. Never again would I place a order from this clown shoes of a company! You are crooks.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7221,"Order experience was good. I would recommend that this business integrate proofing prior to press to ensure they get it right. Our order had an error which could've been caught prior to press run.

Customer service on our order was great. They handled with utmost professional approach. Well done!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7222,"Bad experience with t-shirt elephant. The colours printed were completely wrong, and the graphic had a weird white border around it. A quick QA step on their end could mitigate things like this. They have agreed to reprint the shirts, so will update my review based on those results.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7223,The program for making the t-shirt was super easy to use. There are lots of options. The product arrived exactly when predicted. They had get there in time for christmas options. I am super satisfied with this site and I will use them again.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7224,"I love coming here to say great things about great people. Too bad this is not one of these moments. T-Shirt Elephant has low quality product, poor execution, bad quality prints, unskilled staff, and the worst customer service ever. They basically do everything wrong and when you complain, they say it's your fault. Makes me sad. I feel sorry for them.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7225,Very happy with our first order with T-shirt Elephant. The quality of the print is good and the t-shirts we picked are very soft. Will order from you guys again!,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7226,"The products received were as expected, and the order came in reasonable time. But due to a mistake in the store's website some products I ordered were not available. This was disappointing. Further, they refunded only the value of those products I did not receive and not the tax on them. And they did not adjust the shipping cost. Overall, if I knew these products were not available, I would not have placed the order at all.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7227,t-shirt elephants products did not disappoint and arrived in a timely fashion. Their customer service went above and beyond when I realized I had forgotten to order an extra shirt. Highly recommended :),T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7232,"I love the shirts from here the colour and picture quality it's really good! The shirts also stand up to a lot of use and washes, with a little bit of wear. My only thing I wish I would get is a picture that covers the entire front to the shirt. When making the shirts in the template it shows that it's what I'll be getting but when they arrive it's just a larger picture in the middle.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7233,"Terrible customer service and delivery services. I got a shipping confirmation email nearly a month ago which said it would arrive in 2-4 business days. It didn't so I reached out to customer service and still haven't heard a reply back. That was a few weeks ago

I just want my shirt man",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7234,"Used them to start a business since they are in Canada and didn't want the hassle of borders and exchange.
They don't do any checking of images you send in, they just print them regardless of how digitized they are when they are blown up. They reprinted and resent this at no charge but they do not review your image as they say they do.
They are very criptic with their pricing and won't tell you full costs unless you get on the phone with them.
They are very slow to repond to emails and more often than not they don't answer the question so typically I had to call.
It takes them 2 weeks to print a shirt then they ship it..This is print on demand it should be days not weeks.
They messed up commissions constantly and everytime you get a statement the amounts differ..I am still waiting for payment from their error..I spent numerous calls trying to sort out the right numbers.
You always have to call them in order for them to actually do anything.
I have moved to a new supplier who can perform the way they say they will.
Stay away if you are trying to run a business.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7235,"Don't waste your time/money - this company is a joke..The worst customer service I've ever experienced..We ordered tshirts for a baseball team under the impression that their 14 day guarantee would hold up.Don't let their fancy website and positive reviews on their own website fool you.after thet 14 day guarantee passed, we contacted the company and it was virtually IMPOSSIBLE to reach anyone..Always goes to voicemail, emails un-returned, left messages on every single extension at the company with not a single return phone call..I lost track of how many voicemails and emais we left..We were finally able to get the company's attention only by inquiring via their 'contact us' form on their website - we anonymously asked how long shipping would take for a new order, and what do you know, they answered right away - only then did they give the explanation that the shirts weren't here because of backorder from their supplier..When they finally did ship the shirts (over a month later) there were 4 shirts missing and 2 were the wrong size and the quality was less than desirable, and our ball season was essentially over. Do not waste your time/money on this company. I could go on and on. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT/WASTE OF MONEY!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7236,"We ordered 14 (I think) ball shirts, the sleeves are a bit long, next time I would size down (I sized up according to the chest in the size chart) but they came on time and look great! Great price!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7237,The website was very easy to use and it gave me a lot of options to customize the shirt..The product showed up ahead of schedule and it was exactly what was shown to me in the preview. The process was seamless and I look forward to doing business with them again.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7238,"the sweater itself wasn't too bad, however I specifically wanted my print smaller and it came out larger than expected. the print wasnt as opaque as i wanted it to be and just looks cheaply printed on. Overall not bad but just not worth the price.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7240,I received 6 polo shirts today for a corporate event. I can't imagine anyone doing a worse possible job than these shirts. The logos are ironed-on labels that appear to have been printed in someone's basement on a $50 printer and then irregularly ironed. This is despite their website stating clearly that they never use iron-ons. I could not possibly be more disappointed. I could have done a better job myself. Still waiting to hear about a refund.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7241,"Order a printed hat but logo was not printed correctly ,.I designed the hat with a bigger logo and placed to the right of the hat but they centered it and logo was small . I contacted customer service but they refused to fix the problem all they afford was 10% discount what a joke . It's a good thing I didn't place a bigger order as I just wanted to try them out but I would not order again . Save yourself the head ache and order from Vista print better customer service",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7242,"Very impressed!
I did not have the time necessary to do the job but Client Service told me they could deliver within my deadline. And they did! Even 3 days earlier that promised.
The T-shirts were of good quality, the picture that I supplied was really well reproduced.
Being of advertising background, I am VERY fussy.

7254,"(aka has marketing aka sterling screen printing) 6+ years working with screen printers and have never experienced such a poorly managed company - they have been holding.our goods hostage for over two months. no one will respond to you, via phone or email. sent couriers direct to get our goods from them, refused to give them to us. save yourself a gigantic, months-long, unmistakable headache and go elsewhere.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7255,"Was quite disappointed with the service here as I did not receive any notifications that my order arrived and had to follow up with an email for them to respond that they were sorry I didn't get an email and told me my order was ready. At pickup, I was instructed to go through a side door and I walked through the door to find an incredibly filthy factory and had to ask some random guy standing around nearby to get my order.

In terms of the quality of the product, it was to my satisfaction and no complaints but wholistically factoring in their lack of customer satisfaction, I probably won't order here again.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7256,"This was one of the worest experiences of my online purchasing experiences.

No sample sizes given and no actual photos of the product on the website (only computer generated ones).

Printing was done wrong several times (wrong colour, missing our logo).

It took over a month to rectifiy the situation and during that time the initial sales person either quite or was let go. At this point I was unable to get a hold of anyone via phone. I was told only e-mail communication woud be permitted.

There are other Canadian online options that are available that I would recommend using over this company.

Unsatisfied and an overall very disappointing expereince. I would NOT recommend using this company if you want the job done right!",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7258,"While I was really happy with how the purchase (hat) looked, the hat itself is super uncomfortable - so much so that it is unwearable. I raised this with customer service and they offered a 10% discount on my next purchase. I think replacing the hat would have been more appropriate. Unfortunately, after spending $46 on a hat and it being unwearable, I don't expect to purchase from them again.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7266,"Just got my shirts in the mail. The print is amazing however, the XL shirt was obviously smaller than the medium shirt (it looked like a small). Emailed customer service and since the shirts weren't personalized, I'm out of luck. The solution suggested by customer service was give the medium to the person who fits into a XL and the (small) XL to the person who wears medium. Yes, because someone who needs an XL can wear a medium size shirt.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

I would like to support Canadian Business as well as some of the other reviewers however I work in Customer Service and this company does not have it.

7275,"Made my order of 10 hoodies with prints on the back, front & sleeves. The material they used was so garbage that out of the box the print was already all cracked on the sleeves.

7294,"I ordered a tshirt for my boyfriend, a medium Gildan shirt is actually fairly large. The white print on it was also very patchy, with numerous tiny holes that let you see the black shirt underneath. Furthermore, the print did not reach to the edges of the shirt like it was displayed on the computer.
This design was actually a duplicate I made for my boyfriend as the one I got him last year from pmall was starting to show wear and tear. I will not be buying a shirt from here again, go to pmall, it's cheaper and ready in a few moments (no need to pay for shipping).",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

Ordered ball shirts, numbers on the back we're the wrong colour, 2 showed up with no numbers at all and when the FINALLY answered back they said too bad so sad. You are taking a chance with this place if you order from them.

7308,"I had five t-shirts made for my grown kids. I hate to admit this but they were used in the making of t-shirt quilts. There were missing shirts representing events in their lives --especially my daughter who never keeps anything. It was so easy to use the website --even for a 70 year old. I was able to save and upload images from the web --eg. my son's high school logo and size the words and images to fit the 12x12 "" requirement for the quilt. They arrived more than a week before I was expecting them and they were beautiful -- I couldn't believe how a crest I uploaded was so perfectly reproduced. It was so hard to have to cut them for the quilt but now that I realize how easy they are to make and how well they turn out, I will be making some to actually be worn.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V
7309,"Easy, fast and affordable.

My main criticism would be that the design does not appear to be scaled on each t-shirt. Maybe it would be helpful to have a preview the design on small medium vs large or have an option to scale to fit the size of the shirt.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

They then said they apopologize and will. Ship out Thursday. It did not.

And then on friday no one is available to chat, email or take a phone call, absolutely unacceptable and my order is useless since I needed it before the end of this week.Terrible service, would avoid at all costs",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7327,"Terrible customer service. I placed an order in early August which was expected to arrive by September 9th. By the 16th I still hadn't received anything so I contacted the company. They told me that it was going to print immediately (meaning they completely forgot my order and was rushing to get it done now after nearly a month of waiting) - and that I would have it by the following Tuesday. Well.the following Tuesday came and went and nothing received.

Eventually cancelled my order with nothing received.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7329,"I ordered 4 prints on clothing there with 2 different graphics. On the website you can size and move the graphic to be appealing.

First: 5 weeks after ordering, still no news. The provided ETA by the company overdue. I write them and a week later it arrived.

Then:
It's a very cheap iron on print.
They used one of the graphics on all of the pieces of clothing. Not the second one.
And to make it super cheap and easy for them they used the same size for all of them.
Completely ignoring the provided design from their design website!
This looks horrible.
I also chose a ‚Äúused washed out‚Äù look for the graphics as it works well with the 80s look, but this was also not applied.

I wrote a mail to customer service that this is unacceptable work and they are not replying to me! I remind them every week and It's been 3 weeks of them ignoring me.
And those 4 pieces of clothing cost me 200$ and I got the cheapest laziest print.

UPDATE
After 4 weeks they got back to me, offering me to reprint the shirts with the wrong signature design. They double checked with me that the sizing and placement was correct. Which was a very pleasant interaction and lead to nice and correct shirts.
With the last experience I change my one star rating to two.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

I had a problem with my order and when I told them, they sent me a 15% code with which to be honest I wasn't really happy with. The thing is that when I bought another shirt, they sent me a second one for free and this was the absolute best thing ever.

7847,"I ordered some custom jerseys for my Softball Team and they were excellent quality and exactly what I expected.

However, the customer service side seems to be non-existent. I had sent them an inquiry via email about some other options for my order and never got a reply. I had also tried to phone them on numerous occasions and left a message, but got no reply. I guess my advice would be be 100% sure of your order before you place it.",T-Shirt Elephant ,V

7853,The logo on my hoodies did not arrive as ordered. They made the decision to change it without telling me and I'm the one who has to pay for 2 hoodies that we can't wear. I also deplore their very poor customer service. I do not recommend doing business with this company.,T-Shirt Elephant ,V

8834,"If you want a t-shirt, this is the ONLY place to go. I had never had an image that I wanted to print onto a t-shirt until recently. I brought in my thumb drive with image. The owner must have spent 30 minutes with my wife and me, carefully adjusting the color, deciding on the size of the image on the t-shirt and of course fitting us perfectly. The final product is exactly what I wanted. The t-shirt was made as we waited and the cost was less then we had anticipated. Thank you TSHIRTGUYS.CA..Paul Hart",tshirtguys,z

As a Graphic Designer, it's sometimes difficult to find people that will execute exactly what you asked for but the team at TShirtGuys made sure everything was what I wanted and more. You will not regret giving them your business. I surely will be back. 20 thumbs up!",tshirtguys,z

Amazon let me down which gave me the opportunity to support a local business instead. Lesson learned, just support the local business first.,  called and spoke with Jenny to discuss some embroidery work I needed done and was running out of time due to a weird situation with the first place I thought I had lined up. She verbally confirmed embroidery was something they do and told me to come in the next morning. They moved so it was a solid 30 minute drive from me but thats ok i needed the work done. When I arrived I was very disappointed to hear that embroidery is NOT something they can do. I was so clear when I spoke with Jenny about my needs so I don't understand where this went sideways. A warning to anyone else caught in the same situation because although the owner is pleasant enough, he really didn't seem to care. §∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",tshirtguys,z

Several other places I called around to turned me away because they couldn't print just one, or they couldn't do same day, or they wanted an arm and a leg to rush the order. Not to mention most of the people I spoke to were really rude.

Jenny was so accomodating and kind when I called in a desperate panic. They were able to print it the same day at a reasonable rate. When I went to pick it up I was met with warm staff.

When I picked it up, they made me aware of some irregularities and offered to have it remade, with a higher quality sweatshirt so the print would turn out better, at no extra cost to me. Sarah was the person helping me, and she could not have been more friendly, professional, accommodating and wonderful. She was a pleasure to deal with from start to finish. I picked up my remade sweatshirt this morning and it is literally perfect. I should also mention I have used them in the past for large orders for my business and I was equally impressed.

They delivered the shirt to my house (free of charge) and it looked fantastic. I was a bit disappointed that the graphic was not printed exactly where I wanted it on the shirt so I sent them an email to let them know and to thank them for their effort. Knowing all businesses are suffering during this time, I was not expecting the following: they printed me a new shirt and delivered it to my house (at least a half hour drive from the store), free of charge. They went above and beyond to make a customer happy!

From the get-go, when my print order was just an idea, Ellen provided very detailed information to help me decide on how I would like to print my shirt, Besides the great quality of the shirts and the printing, interactions with Ellen made working with T-Shirt Guys a standout experience. She is patient with follow-up questions, and is always friendly and informative. She kept communications open before the printing process so that I was clear on costs and also during production when designers had questions about my image files. When there was an edit needed to translate digital to print, she called with solutions and was also open to dialogue with me and to adopt the option I was most comfortable with.

( I had specifically asked, and paid, for Bella & Canvas and it was substituted with American Apparel). I immediately emailed them and got a fairly short response that they use the two brands interchangeably and I would be refund the $2 difference. I realize this is a small problem but I specifically asked for and wanted the Bella and Canvas shirt and not thrilled that they would use a cheaper ( by $2 but still) shirt that I would have paid more for had I not noticed the swap. The printing is beautiful and the service was quick and friendly but I wont be able to recommend this business. Maybe attention to detail could be something to work on in the new year.",tshirtguys,z

8921,"This is the THIRD time I've come to T-ShirtGuys for my t-shirts and tank tops. What's amazing is that on top of the fact that they do such good work and they always try their best to give you the best deal out there, they still manage to blow me away with the level of customer service they provide me. I've been with them for over 2 years now and I probably see them once a year and yet, I still truly feel like a valued customer, not just a random walking in from the streets. I tell all my friends and clients about them and they've all been very pleased with their projects as well. I would never think about getting my stuff printed anywhere else!",tshirtguys,z

The team at TSG are very good at sorting out your art, setting up, adjusting and prototyping. They have lots of options and the service is always friendly (even if I'm a noob and give them impossible timelines)
Thanks for another successful run of shirts again this year Katherine.

8937,"Leave a deposit and pay the rest when you get your shirts. They inverted my logo and it's taking longer than they told me it would take to fix. I trust that these guys are really good at what they do, and mistakes happen, but just be cautious. Safe bet would be to leave the deposit down and pay the rest when you get your correct shirts. I'm sure I will shop there again once it's all done and made right.",tshirtguys,z
8938,"Not only was I in a rush to have a couple tshirts made, but I also wanted a specific printing style. Plus, I didn't have time to make it into the store so this was all done over the phone. I went into the store a bit nervous because I couldn't pick exactly what material I wanted, but was pleasantly surprised with my order. The TShirt Guys did an amazing jod at providing me with as much detail as possible about my order before hand and even sent me draft mock ups of the placement of my text and image that was going on the TShirt. I would recommend them to any one looking to purchase custom apparel and I will be going back for future orders. Thanks again!",tshirtguys,z
8939,"Poor customer service. Staff did not help clients in order (I arrived before someone else and he was helped before me). And then I placed an order and paid and found out the next day that they didn't have the colours I ordered: ""The stock was fine when you placed the order -- sometimes we run into an issue where the stock depletes in within the hour. That is out of our control as our supplier is a major Canadian garment provider. Our apologies -- but it does happen, all we can do is try and switch colours to an available option."" I only ordered 2 toddler t-shirts and would expect they would put these aside when I paid. Or at least provided some kind of discount since they were not able to provide what I paid for.",tshirtguys,z
8940,Our basketball players and coaches love the championship sweatshirts we got! Ellen was great to work with and answered our questions quickly and thoroughly. We will be back to order more - when we win again!,tshirtguys,z

Great job guys, see you soon!",tshirtguys,z
8942,"My late mother-in-law had a wonderful shortbread recipe and baked it every holiday. To honour her memory I had decided to have permanent copies of the recipe printed. With the help of the T-ShirtGuys, particularly Katherine and Steven, I was able to create the best Christmas gifts ever! I worked with Katherine just under 2 weeks. My original 12-year-old, typed copy was formatted in a new layout; three different font sizes and font styles were chosen, and 23 lines of text were perfectly spaced over the 18‚Äùx26‚Äù area of a cotton tea towel. I brought in 5 tea towels of varied quality and patterns to be tested and used for printing. One minor adjustment was made in the first printing and all remaining results were successful. In the end, 17 tea towels were printed with ‚ÄúHelen's Christmas Shortbread‚Äù recipe. I don't imagine this was a huge order for the T-ShirtGuys but it was a very special order for me - near and dear to my heart. I feel that Katherine and Steven put as much care, effort and thought into my small printing needs as they would have with any bigger project. The people who received these early Christmas gifts were quite touched - as one family member said, ‚ÄúMarking the first Christmas without Mum was so right and enshrining one of her loving annual traditions in a pretty tea towel . ahhh.‚Äù Thank you T-ShirtGuys. Thank you Katherine and Steven. It was the most gift-giving fun for me, ever.‚Äù.Jean Simon",tshirtguys,z

8953,"Ellen and the staff at T-Shirt Guys were very friendly, helpful and accommodating to the many requests + inquiries that I had for our staff t-shirts and hoodies. Their responses to e-mails and telephone calls were prompt. Thanks for all of your help! As Arnold would say, 'I'll be back.'",tshirtguys,z
8954,"The owner is rude and abusive.

I had them confirm for my quote - twice - that I was going to go through with the order on the condition that the shirts were made in North America. After I paid for and received my shirts, the tag said they were made in Bangladesh.

Clearly, they made a mistake which I was willing to overlook as long as they remedied the situation. They offered a refund, but I was shocked when the owner then had the nerve to start an argument with me based on his ""feelings about the situation"" and yell at me over the phone for his mistake claiming that I was trying to scam him because no one could possibly expect to have a shirt printed for $30 each from North America (which, by the way, I have already found at a different store for $32 each - American Apparel)..He then proceeded to tell me how wrong I was to want shirts made in North America in the first place. His behaviour was nothing short of rude, abusive and completely inappropriate towards anyone let alone his paying customers. There are plenty of other options in Toronto.",tshirtguys,z
8955,Amazing service! Very helpful. Very pleased with my shirt design and purchase. Will be going back for more.,tshirtguys,z

I love how I wanted to print stupid shirts for a gag and needed 8 of them and they directed me to a route that would be quick, easy and very low budget..What a bright shiny place with a cast and crew that will make you laugh then offer you a freezey in the summer or a cookie when its cold.
I stopped in a few times over the years and its forever changing and growing.
I love how they have 3 clocks side by each with toronto, hamilton and someone named Cathy all with different times.
There are a couple of really cute dogs that I was welcomed to bring my Max in to make friends with.
Everyone is always warm and friendly..Often with a side chat about what someone else suggest they all have a great eye for design and will help you make the most out of your branding.
All in all this has been my go to shop for all my cafe merch.",tshirtguys,z

8982,"Trusted this company to help launch our clothing brand and we never completed an order without a hiccup, misunderstanding, or quality issue.

9037,"Bought a custom large canvas for 220$. Paid in advance. Told me it would take 2 weeks to get. 2 weeks turned into 3, 3 into 4.and everytime I contacted them I got the runaround that it was almost ready and they'd call me soon.

A full 31 days after I had given them my money, I went to the Atwater store before being told it was ready.but at Eaton Center store.but after getting there the employee told me they didn't have the frame. Asked for a refund.and the employee had to call someone who I figured was the manager. We agree to a refund. They have to send it by email transfer though for some reason.

3 hours later get a call telling me my canvas is ready and I have to come pick it up. I tell the woman I already agreed to a refund and she just hangs up without a word.

5 days later I call to see what's up woth the refund and that I want to talk to a manager. I get the runaround and a promos that the manager will call me back within the hour. 8 hours later, no call, no text, no email.

I consider my money now simply lost. AVOID AT ALL COST they will scam you wihout a second thought.",tshirtguys,z

9039,"I was super excited to get my custom shirt. There was a new employee who helped me was very helpful. The shirt took about 20 minutes to print.

When I returned there was a heavy set man who I assumed was the manager or the owner. He was so disrespectful. He acted as if he was doing me a favour by being there. He was so bad I considered taking my money elsewhere but I had already paid and knew this guy wasn't the person who was going to help me get a refund. Maybe that was the reason for the attitude? He knew I had already paid so I would just have to take it.
On top of the terrible treatment, the shirt started chipping within a few weeks. So, the service was terrible, the product was over priced and the quality was ultimately lacking. GO ELSEWHERE.",Urban Customz Centre Eaton ,AA

9542,"TERRIBLE experience! We put in an order on Wednesday for a T-shirt which was planned as a birthday gift for the weekend. I provided an example of what I wanted, paid in full immedy and then made arrangements for pick up. Despite the company being called ""Next day t-shirts"" the earliest available pick up time was Friday. We agreed to a 1pm pick up and I confirmed twice, explaining that I had a meeting at 2:15 in Burlington. I arrived to pick the shirt up at 1:40 and was told that they were still working on the mock up of the shirt. It hadn't even been started. She gave me a line about only receiving the example a few minutes earlier, perhaps she thought she had spoken to someone else on Wednesday, but as I was the person who placed the order AND sent the example, I knew I had sent it straight away. I also knew that we had firmly agreed upon a pick up time and that she was aware of my meeting. I left to pick up my husband to give them more time to complete the shirt. When we returned 10 minutes later, my husband went in and found that they were not even working on the order. She lied again, saying she had only receive the example image 2 minutes earlier, and then made a fuss about apparently not knowing I had a meeting and it being difficult to print on a dark grey t-shirt, so it wasn't reasonable that I would expect it done two days after the initial order. Long and Short, the shirt looks okay, and they DID give me a refund for the trouble, but honestly, the whole experience was awful and it isn't worth it to me to give them anymore business.",Next day t-shirts,K

9612,"Overall very good communication throughout the printing process. The prices are reasonable too, especially when making bulk orders. However, there is room for improvement. The text printed on the back for black shirts have weird misprint or ink residues from other shirts and it really affects the aesthetic appeal of the shirt.

Every part of working with Coastal Reign is seamless and easy. The quality of their materials and their printing + embroidery is perfect. I would recommend Coastal to anyone looking for their services every time I am asked. I look forward to working with them again soon.",Coastal Reign Printing,B
9616,"Summary: making mistakes in printing, no product quality control, slow turn around. very reluctant to do proper customer support.
I online-ordered embroidered zip-up hoodies and printed t-shirts with my company logo and year number. The year number got printed with a wrong font for both zip-up hoodies and t-shirts, making them look different from the web preview.
At least, the year number was properly center-aligned, so we accepted them. If we haven't, they would have to re-embroider, which we thought would cause too much trouble for them. So we were simply being nice (which we regret now)
However, the year number on the t-shirts were shifted left so visibly, so we asked for reprint via the company's email customer support channel. The customer rep asked me to drop off the t-shirts to the shop, and then they would reprint them right away. When I pointed it out that it was an online order, thus issuing a return shipping label is the correct process, the rep finally gave me the shipping label. But getting the replacement T-shirts took more than a week. (so right away means more than 1 week?) When I contacted the customer support again while waiting, I was told that the garment had to be ordered, so there is the delay. (so printing shop doesn't have any garment in stock?)Finally we received the replacement T-shirts, But this time, one of them had a sewing issue. When I contacted the customer support about it with pictures(attached below), the rep said now I have to pay for the shipping because it is uncertain if it's the defect from their ship. The reasoning is because I did not contact them promptly after I get their replacement shipment. (Yes, the T-shirts were sitting in the original packaging for 30 days since I received them, and the only thing I checked right after receiving the t-shirts was if the logo and year number is properly printed) I've ordered many T-shirts and hoodies for my company, and this was the only online company that made this many mistakes and had poor quality control and customer support. Maybe Coastal Reign Printing is okay for offline orders, but definitely not ready for online orders. UPDATE: After reading my review, someone in the company contacted me and offered free return shipping as well as partial refund. However, I had to decline. My reasonings were - I tried(and failed) to resolve this issue via their customer support channel already, which made me waste enough time. - if I accept any refund after leaving a bad public review, that would make my review as blackmailing, which is not how I do business.",Coastal Reign Printing,B
9617,I had a FANTASTIC experience with Coastal Reign! I worked with them for about 2 months on a tote bag design and there was a lot of back and forth (mostly me being indecisive haha). The entire time they were so patient and accommodating. They made it so easy and a pleasure to work with! 100% would order again from them!,Coastal Reign Printing,B
9618,"High quality items, our account rep was amazing to work with. Items arrived quickly and were better than expected.",Coastal Reign Printing,B

I will be using them as our exclusive representative for promotional gear going forward.,Coastal Reign Printing,B
9620,"I've been using Coastal Reign for a few months now and am quite happy with the clothing and print quality. I always try to look for a company with great customer service and communication when printing clothing and Coastal Reign has been great at both. They state clearly the expected pick up time so there are no surprises when an order is ready. Minor thing I've found is that around 1 of 100 shirts may have a bit of ink smudged somewhere from the screenprinting process causing the shirt to be stained a bit. From the large quantities of clothing Coastal Reign prints out you should also expect some lint. Otherwise, very happy so far and will continue using for my business.",Coastal Reign Printing,B
9621,"Anson was very helpful and responsive.

They have fast and Professional service, great designs and high quality items. Highly recommend.",Coastal Reign Printing,B

Product delivery was completed in timely manner even during COVID-19. I would definitely recommend this company!",Coastal Reign Printing,B
9624,"I first heard about Coastal Reign when I was in high school playing ultimate. Back then it was really cool getting sublimated prints for ultimate jerseys and although I am not sure where my ultimate team ordered their jerseys, I looked into Coastal Reign products when my dance team needed team apparel. The order process was easy and streamlined, and process time was fast. As I moved into university and ordered more apparel for clubs I am involved in, I discovered that Coastal Reign website updates made the entire process extremely user-friendly, as I am able to calculate cost directly on the site without even contacting reps for quotes, and it even lets me design my product as well as customizing. This speeds up the ordering process immensely. Every single order the Coastal Reign artists helped touch up my artwork for free and I can't be thankful enough! Shipping was also free of charge when I ordered over a certain amount (it wasn't too hard to reach that amount). This also solved my problems converting from USD to CAD sometimes for US printing sites. Other local printing companies that I have worked with do not often put taxes, discounts, and shipping costs into consideration when I ask them for a quote, and Coastal Reign definitely delivers on time and their products are always fabulous. My favourite printing company to work with as they have great customer service! Receiving the big turquoise box in the mail always puts a smile on my face.",Coastal Reign Printing,B
9625,"Editing my review from a 3 star to a 4 star.

Originally had errors with a recent order that were fixed by Coastal Reign, which I very much appreciate! I don't want a negative review to be stuck on their page, as I've had far more positive experiences with the company in regards to large mask orders. My only hope is that quality remains with all aspects of production, communication remains clear with future orders and that they are open to making corrections to any issue with an order promptly.

Thank you so much for the hard work and for providing a service that is highly valued in these times! My own customers have been extremely satisfied with the masks they've received that contain my own designs, and I really hope to continue providing more!",Coastal Reign Printing,B
9626,"This is an amazing printing business that deserves to be recognized! I have been using Coastal Reign for several projects now for our business and have always been impressed with the results. We have ordered hoodies, t shirts and long sleeve shirts with our custom logo several times now. The customer service is 5++ stars.

They offer many choices for clothes depending on what the price range is, so if you're wanting to go super high quality or on budget, they make it possible every time. Additionally, this is a great business to use if you're looking for a smaller quantity of items as they offer discounts usually once you purchase 3+ items.",Coastal Reign Printing,B
9627,"I had a small order (3 items) with a special image that needed some attention. So, not a big company with a logo ready-to-go and hundreds of items. Yet they were great dealing with my special request, gave me individualized attention (thanks, Anson!), and perfect results.

I did receive 2 broken mugs, but considering they were shipped across Canada, I don't feel this was Coastal Reigns error. My 4/5 star rating is because I felt the stock/prices online changed a lot and I had to adjust my plan a couple times. Overall I was impressed and happy to support a Canadian company.",Coastal Reign Printing,B
9631,"The team at Coastal Reign really went above and beyond to help us achieve our vision!

9637,"Amazing service! I ordered a few t-shirts and hoodies with funny pics of our golden retriever on them, and I LOVED the result. But the best part was how Jeffrey (the guy I was dealing with) made sure that I got one remaining t-shirt, and he had it couriered to my house so that I could get it to a dear friend on time for Christmas. Super nice guys from start to finish. I'm always excited to support a business like this one. I'll be back.",Coastal Reign Printing,B

He helped me nail down the best product and decide between a vinyl printed image and embroidered one, giving pros and cons for both. I asked for a guarantee that the items would be delivered by Feb. 17 as I needed them for Feb. 18, and I was guaranteed- barring any new shipping delays - the package would be in hand on Feb. 17. I just received the package Feb. 11, a full week before I was expecting it. My only issue was the sizing description for the pants/sweats were not helpful, there were no waistband or inseam measurements for the products I was looking at which made it hard to discern how big the items would be.",Coastal Reign Printing,B

9748,"Overall positive experience. I dealt with Nikki, she had a very vibrant personality and provided excellent customer service. The products received met my exact expectations. Will do business with them in the very near future.",Coastal Reign Printing,B
9749,"I've ordered from Coastal Reign a few times over the last year and their product/embroidery is overall decent. Their receptionist/sales girl is fairly new. She was mostly helpful with me on my orders. There are a couple of things that, to me, lowers the rating. They are:

1) They don't have a designated.parking area, at least at their old location. Not sure with the new one. I had to walk a few blocks to get to their store. Not a huge deal, just thought it would have been slightly more covenient if they had at least a couple spots for their customers. Their storefront is limited and feels a bit under equipped (wanted to touch and feel the materials for design purposes).

2) I was given an invoice/quote that had an item at a certain price and upon calling to confirm an order in the new year, the price had increased astoundingly; close to 50% without any mention on the website or through email. I also wasn't given any, ""we'll give it to you at your invoice price"" either, and was told that bigger orders (100+ items) would retain the old pricing. My orders are usually 10-20 pieces at a time, not 100+. Before, I would get the reasonable prices on 10+ items - so tha't increased to over 10x as well. That would mean I would have to order over 3 thousand dollars worth of merchandise just to keep the current pricing! Not impressed with this move.

Given the nature of all this, I realize they are a fairly new business. However, it has been frustrating dealing with the lack of clear communication on pricing. Overall, I am generally pleased with their product and embroidery. It's their customer service communication and pricing arrangement is what keeps them at 3 stars. Othewise I would have given them more.",Coastal Reign Printing,B
9750,"An outstanding team at Coastal Reign!

Very easy to work with, great communication and a great local supplier.

9756,i was very excited to find a local place that did screen printing on clothing.

9757,"Horrible service. Ordered jackets - and when it came time to confirm, they ""ran out"" of the jackets I requested.

Barely even two months and now all the letters are falling off. Disappointed.",Coastal Reign Printing,B

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For context on this review we used Coastal Reign for 7 months, spent over $7,500 over 11 separate orders. We switched suppliers a few months ago and tonight my business partner and I sat down and looked at our sunk cost for apparel costs over the last 6 months. We almost quit running the shop after Christmas because it seemed impossible to make money at this. lol turns out it‚Äôs totally possible as long as you don‚Äôt use Costal Reign for your printing?

Like honestly, I want to cry but I want to laugh because I can‚Äôt believe we stayed. They were incredibly rude to us every time we called, misprinted multiple orders and the their turn around time is like a month and a half *unless you pay a rush fee*

If you stay long enough you realize the 10% rush fee is part of the business model. It's dishonest and even when you pay rush they'd just drag out the process, change the expected by date (sometimes by WEEKS) and suggest a 25% rush fee.
We spent almost 1 grand in rush fees and complimentary products for clients who'd waited over a month for back ordered products. It‚Äôs astonishing. I also cannot stress enough how rude they were to us on a regular basis. Some of these friendly reviews seem suspicious, they ask you to scan a qr code and leave a review after every order and the running joke with my team is like ""lol they'll regret asking that if we left an honest review after this""

The reason we switched was because they misprinted up an order. 10/25 shirts were off centre by almost 2 inches. We didn't bust out a measuring tape to check before mailing them and then we got dragged online by a customer. When I called to ask for reprints the guy who answered said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna let you in on a little secret, the most successful brands who users do their own quality control‚Äù like bruh, what?

HOW MANY UNSUCCESSFUL BRANDS DO YOU WORK WITH MY DUDE??

If you think you‚Äôre getting a good price call a few other shops because you‚Äôre really not. One of our first orders we spent almost $17 per piece for a one colour print on an ACT everyday cotton t-shirt because they bake the set up fee into the order. Here's the other thing you realize if you shop around, that's not normal. With Coastal Reign the price never *really* lowers. We're paying almost half the price now and the quality is better, turnaround time is 2 weeks and the people who work there are not mean.

I feel like I need to talk to my therapist about why I hate myself enough to have tolerated their behaviour.",Coastal Reign Printing,B
